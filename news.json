In an interview with , Jain said that securities may lie unclaimed due to lack of awareness, change of address, failure to update contact information, death of the shareholder with uninformed heirs, lost documentation, and inactive accounts. Edited Excerpts: What are unclaimed shares and dividends? Unclaimed shares and dividends are equity shares and their payouts that have not been claimed by their rightful owners even after the declaration of a dividend. Reasons include lack of awareness, outdated contact information, or heirs being unaware of investments. These shares and if unclaimed for seven years or more are accumulated and transferred to the IEPF Authority as per regulatory requirements. What are the reasons for these securities lying unclaimed? Securities may lie unclaimed due to lack of awareness, change of address, failure to update contact information, death of the shareholder with uninformed heirs, lost documentation, and inactive accounts. These factors contribute to shareholders losing track of their investments, resulting in unclaimed assets. Also Read: Could you demonstrate how unclaimed investment identification and claims could be made easier using contemporary technologies like blockchain or artificial intelligence? Blockchain can provide a transparent mechanism for tracking ownership and automating transfers of unclaimed assets through smart identification of claimants. Artificial Intelligence can analyze data to detect unclaimed investments and match them with potential owners by cross-referencing sources like death records and address changes. These technologies can streamline and secure the identification and claims process. What part, in your opinion, do organizations such as yours and financial advisors have in assisting clients in managing and recovering their unclaimed investments? Organizations like Share Samadhan and financial advisors play a key role by educating clients, providing end-to-end support services, and maintaining proactive communication with Registrars, Companies, and Authorities. They help in professionally managing the entire paperwork along with legal documentation and follow up with various authorities to assist the investor with the claims process. Also Read: What proactive measures can be taken to reduce these risks and how might changes in personal circumstances, such as marriage, migration, or work changes, contribute to the problem of unclaimed investments? Proactive measures include regularly updating contact information, consolidating accounts, financial planning, and robust notification systems. Personal changes like marriage, migration, or job changes often lead to address updates that, if not communicated, result in unclaimed investments. Timely updates and proactive financial management can mitigate these risks. Would you please provide the most recent estimate of the amount of unclaimed deposits and investments in India, including mutual funds, shares, and debentures? The latest data indicates that unclaimed deposits and investments in India, including , shares, and debentures, amount to several thousand crores of rupees. Regulatory authorities like SEBI and RBI periodically update these figures, highlighting the significant volume of unclaimed assets in the country. If we talk about an estimate of some of the amount of unclaimed investment in various asset classes, shares transferred to IEPF amount to 29,000 crores, mutual funds to 24000 crores, PPF to 48000 crores, bank accounts to 26000 crores, etc. What is the cause of India's extraordinarily high rate of unclaimed investments and deposits? India's high rate of unclaimed investments and deposits is due to a lack of financial literacy, inefficient record-keeping, high demographic mobility, inheritance issues, and regulatory gaps. There is a need to increase financial literacy and investor awareness to keep financial record updates. Addressing these issues with better education, communication, and technological solutions can help reduce unclaimed investments, and ensure rightful owners reclaim their assets.

The Winklevoss brothers, whose company recently settled with US and New York state financial regulators over allegations of misconduct, announced their donations on the social media platform X, without specifying the recipient of the funds. The crypto industry is increasingly trying to influence US politicians as it faces heightened scrutiny from regulators.", "content": "The billionaire Winklevoss twins, founders of the cryptocurrency company Gemini , have made headlines once again with their latest announcement. On Thursday, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss revealed on social media platform X that they each donated $1 million in Bitcoin to support Donald Trump \u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. This move positions the twins among the growing number of crypto executives backing the Republican candidate amid heightened regulatory scrutiny. Tyler Winklevoss criticized President Joe Biden \u2019s administration in his post, saying, \"Over the past few years, the Biden administration has openly declared war against crypto. It has weaponized multiple government agencies to bully, harass, and sue the good actors in our industry in an effort to destroy it.\" He added that Trump was \"pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business.\" In recent years, Gemini has faced significant legal challenges. In February, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) announced that Gemini would return at least $1.1 billion to customers of its troubled lending program due to a third party\u2019s bankruptcy. Additionally, the company agreed to pay a $37 million fine for \"unsafe and unsound practices.\" The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also settled a lawsuit with Gemini for $21 million without the firm admitting or denying wrongdoing. Despite these legal hurdles, the Winklevoss twins continue to be influential figures in the crypto industry. They first gained widespread attention after suing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, alleging he had stolen their idea for the social networking site. The lawsuit resulted in a 2008 settlement where the twins received cash and Facebook stock. Donald Trump has positioned himself as a strong supporter of the cryptocurrency sector. At a recent fundraiser in San Francisco, attended by tech executives, he criticized Democratic efforts to regulate the industry and emphasized his commitment to being the \"crypto president.\" Republican National Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon said that Trump \"touted crypto as important and stressed that he was very supportive of the sector,\" although he did not provide specific details on his proposed policies. The cryptocurrency industry is making concerted efforts to influence US political outcomes as it faces increasing regulatory challenges. Major bankruptcies in 2022 exposed fraud and misconduct within the industry, leading to intensified scrutiny from regulators. In response, the crypto sector is investing heavily in political campaigns, with Coinbase recently launching a $2 million ad campaign targeting Latino voters. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, connected to the campaign, highlighted the systemic barriers communities of color face in wealth-building, advocating for crypto as a viable alternative. The Biden administration has expressed a desire to develop a regulatory framework for digital currencies, following an executive order in 2022 aimed at ensuring the responsible development of digital assets. This has led to calls for clearer guidelines from regulatory bodies such as the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

In April, Donald Trump asked oil and gas executives to donate $1 billion to help his 2024 presidential campaign, according to The Washington Post , which reported that he had promised the donors a host of policy favors, including a rollback of President Joe Biden\u2019s environmental regulations and faster, painless corporate mergers. Now, fossil fuel cash is pouring in: Last month, Energy Transfer CEO Kelcy Warren hosted a Houston-area fundraiser for Trump \u2014 and he also donated $5 million to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc. The oil and gas firm Continental Resources, Inc. donated $1 million to MAGA Inc. in late April. Those donations and policy promises are part of a broader pattern: Trump has been making big promises to potential donors, while reportedly requesting huge amounts of cash \u2014 amounts that far exceed the limits on contributions that candidates can accept for their own campaigns. Last month, Trump warned donors that Biden would allow Republicans\u2019 2017 tax law to expire. \u201cThe tax cuts all expire for wealthy and poor and middle-income and everything else, but they expire in another seven months and he\u2019s not going to renew them, which means taxes are going to go up by four times,\u201d Trump said, according to the Post . (The 2017 tax law has disproportionately benefited the wealthy.) He subsequently told top corporate executives he wants to renew the tax programs and further slash the corporate tax rate. Campaign finance records show that Trump\u2019s super PAC received a combined $10 million in May from conservative billionaires Richard and Liz Uihlein. The family, which leads a cardboard box empire , received a $118 million tax deduction in one year thanks to a provision in the GOP\u2019s 2017 tax law, according to reporting by ProPublica .

Trump is also reaping rewards from a change in his stance on cryptocurrencies. In 2021, the former president said that bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam.\u201d Earlier this month, Trump reportedly pitched himself to Silicon Valley donors as \u201cthe crypto president,\u201d and pledged to immediately halt the Biden administration\u2019s scrutiny of the industry. He also reportedly told a group of crypto mining company executives that he wants all bitcoin mining, a highly energy-intensive process, to be done in the United States.

As of Thursday afternoon, DJT\u2019s value had soared by triple-digit percentages, reaching a market capitalization of over $150m . The run on DJT, which shares a three-letter abbreviation with stock in the former president\u2019s actual media company, inspired a feverish search for whether Trump or his campaign was behind the crypto effort. On Tuesday, Arkham, a market intelligence firm, offered a $150,000 bounty for the person who could prove who was behind DJT. A day later, the company announced that a crypto analyst using the X screenname ZachXBT had submitted \u201cdefinitive evidence\u201d that Shkreli, who was released from prison in 2022 for a series of fraud charges related to his time running two hedge funds, was the brains behind the operation. The analyst shared screenshots of what he said were direct messages with Shkreli, in which the former pharmaceutical investor, known for jacking up the price of cancer drugs, claimed, \u201cI have over 1000 pieces of evidence I created it with Barron,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s son. ZachBXT also claimed the coin was linked to a Discord user named Cameron Roxborough, who claimed to be a classmate and friend of Trump\u2019s son. A LinkedIn profile under that name shows Roxborough attending the same Florida school from which Barron Trump recently graduated. After the bounty announcement, Shkreli claimed he created the coin after being approached by Roxborough on behalf of Barron Trump, and that the former president approved of the idea. The investor said in a live X Spaces discussion that he didn\u2019t have any personal incentives in the coin, and created the product to \u201csee where it would go,\u201d and that \u201ceverything\u201d made on the scheme would go to Barron and the Trump family. \u201cI can prove Trump and/or Trump family involvement,\u201d he later wrote on X. The Trump family and campaign have not publicly commented on the DJT coin. The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign and Roxborough for comment.", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 23:03:02", "image_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/12/00/Martin_Shkreli_Wu_Tang_Clan_65248.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "source_id": "independentuk", "source_priority": 290, "source_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/independentuk.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "government,sentiments", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_stats": "positive:2.0,neutral:28.43,negative:69.57"}, {"article_id": "20ed5df7ff795d36c1d14672d9579c80", "title": "A Shadow Looms Over the Prop Trading Industry: It's Our Duty to Rescue It", "link": "https://www.benzinga.com/general/24/06/39424339/a-shadow-looms-over-the-prop-trading-industry-its-our-duty-to-rescue-it", "keywords": "profile+,benzinga,general,earn2trade", "creator": "Kaitlyn Wolf", "video_url": null, "description": "By Osvaldo Guimaraes, Marketing Manager of Earn2TradeA handful of crypto firms have long been fighting a tedious battle to build a positive image for the digital asset industry.

Yet, despite their efforts, if you Google \"crypto scam\" today, you will get over 220 million results\u2014from projects having Ryan Gosling as their lead graphic designer to ICOs vanishing as quickly as they have emerged\u2014even the SEC started joking about the situation. When the crypto industry burst onto the scene, like any individual involved in the financial markets, I was curious to learn more about it. I remember a conversation I had with a friend: \"If you decide to invest, find an exchange that makes cashing out as easy as putting your money in,\" he told me. At the time, this sounded weird to me. I remember imagining what it must feel like not to be able to withdraw your hard-earned profits \u2013 it was basically a theft! This nasty feeling was so strong that it deterred me from the niche. A few years later, I joined the prop trading industry \u2013 a sophisticated domain reserved for serious professional traders. I loved how simple yet transformative the concept was \u2013 a trader with theoretical knowledge but lacking hands-on experience, would undergo rigorous training in a paper trading account, followed by an evaluation program where the prop firm would assess their trading skills based on a set of strict rules. If successful, the prop firm would grant the trader real capital and allow them to retain as much as 80% of the profits they have earned with it. Withdrawals were straightforward, allowing successful traders to seamlessly enjoy the fruits of their labor. A rare win-win situation. Over the past seven years, Earn2Trade has helped thousands of beginners leap to a professional prop trading career. In 2023 alone, we helped fund over 700+ live accounts. Throughout all this time, we have constantly maintained dialogue with our clients\u2014through internal surveys, follow-ups with our success stories, or in public channels like TrustPilot or Discord, for example. This close connection has made it quite clear that being able to withdraw their hard-earned profits easily is among the most important things for our users\u2014as it should be. While this has more or less been the industry norm so far, it seems that things are changing. In a bid to attract more clients, some prop trading firms are flipping the model onto its head. Instead of sticking to rigorous training and evaluation programs to filter out the best and brightest traders and, later on, offer them straightforward withdrawals, they are now luring in users with the promise of easy entry and quick access to capital. This is when the real challenge begins. Some companies don't even provide genuine trading accounts. Instead, they leave traders in a perpetual simulation, effectively denying them the opportunity to become professionals. With others, the real test is withdrawing your funds rather than passing the trading evaluation. Witnessing this change reminded me of the conversation I had with my friend a few years back\u2014remember the one about the importance of finding a crypto exchange that will allow you to cash out easily? However, this time, I am not watching from the sidelines. And while I can't control the situation, I can promise that Earn2Trade will remain faithful to our belief that trading isn't for everyone \u2013 we won't open the doors to anyone just so we can quickly close them behind. It is in our name \u2013 we believe that one should earn the right to become a trader. Once they do, we will be there to support them on their journey to becoming professionals \u2013 with easy withdrawals from day one, no upfront fees from their pocket ( the setup fee is deducted from the trader\u2019s first profit withdrawal ), and actively encouraging and even requiring successful traders to transition to live accounts and start earning money. Regarding the industry, instead of learning from the mistakes that stained the crypto niche, we are leaning toward repeating them. Warren Buffet has said it takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. It is up to us to make sure these aren't the prop trading industry's five minutes.", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 22:28:52", "image_url": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2024/06/20/earn2trade.png?optimize=medium&dpr=1&auto=jpg&height=480&width=720&fit=crop", "source_id": "benzinga", "source_priority": 3903, "source_url": "https://www.benzinga.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/benzinga.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "general", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_stats": "positive:1.75,neutral:84.61,negative:13.64"}, {"article_id": "ffe33d7dcb6873c0f5a064f7e3017e86", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Crypto influencer admits he intentionally ignored Logan Paul\u2019s NFT lawsuit to save on legal fees", "link": "https://www.dailydot.com/debug/cryptozoo-lawsuit-jake-greenbaum/", "keywords": "apple news feed,nfts,cryptocurrency,tech,web3,samsung news feed,logan paul", "creator": "Marlon Ettinger", "video_url": null, "description": "A crypto influencer who Logan Paul blamed for the downfall of his NFT project CryptoZoo never responded to a lawsuit Paul filed against him because he said his lawyers told him it would be cheaper than going to court.Jake Greenbaum, known as the CryptoKing, told the Daily Dot that his lawyers told him the court battle could end up costing him in the millions and turn the case into an \u201congoing issue.\u201dPaul filed a cross-claim against Greenbaum and another man after he was sued in a Texas court for his involvement in an alleged NFT \u201crug-pull\u201d scheme over the CryptoZoo project. The initial lawsuit named Paul, his personal assistant Danielle Strobel, his manager Jeffrey Levin, and three other men: Eduardo Ibanez, Greenbaum, and Ophir Bentov, as being responsible for the allegedly deceptive development of the uncompleted NFT game.The game, which was launched in July 2021, allowed users to trade tokens representing animals who would then \u201cmate\u201d to produce mash-ups of imaginary animals and, in theory, increase in value. NFT mania and crypto meme coins were everywhere at the time, culminating the next year in celebrity cryptocurrency commercials during the Super Bowl. A bubble pop and a string of prosecutions against high-profile crypto-world figures followed.

The Winklevoss brothers are each worth $2.7bn, according to Forbes. They have been grappling with a crypto crackdown, amid the wider fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange. The brothers sued Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing the idea for Facebook from them nearly two decades ago, before founding the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. Gemini, which the twins run, has been banned from operating any crypto lending programs in New York after allegedly misleading thousands of investors on the risks associated with its Earn scheme. Letitia James, the state\u2019s attorney general, claimed that \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d were \u201cswindled\u201d.

Tyler Winklevoss said he used Trump's recently established willingness to take crypto contributions and gave his contribution in the form of 15.47 bitcoin, and his brother posted later that he'd done the same. The money goes to the Trump 47 Committee Inc., according to a spokeswoman. That's a \"joint fundraising committee\" which may divide the amount to comply with legal limits for campaign contributions, meaning the money could be spread across a longer list of Republican benefactors. The brothers have \u2013 all along \u2013 donated matching amounts to U.S. election efforts. It was already a large sum that placed them among the major individual contributors in the 2024 campaigns. Before today, the two had given a total of about $2.7 million each, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures. On the presidential level, they'd already backed most of the prominent contenders that had tried earlier to yank the Republican nomination out from under Trump: Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Gov. Ron Desantis. The bulk of their donations, however, have been to the industry's main political action committee (PAC), Fairshake. Their combined $5 million represents a small but significant share of the Fairshake super PAC contributions that have now almost reached $169 million . That money has been devoted to buying outside ads for congressional candidates in the hope of loading Congress with crypto supporters. The Winklevoss donations to Trump 47 join similar maxed-out contributions from Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder, chairman, and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, and his wife Kelly Lynn Loeffler, a former U.S. senator and CEO of Bakkt; Joe Ricketts, the founder and former CEO of TD Ameritrade; and Robert Bigelow, who owns Budget Suites of America and founded the now-defunct Bigelow Aerospace.

The other four claims in the class action securities lawsuit \u2013 the so-called \u201cfailure to register claims\u201d \u2013 were tossed out on Thursday by Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. \u201cWe are pleased that the California court dismissed all class action claims. The one individual state law claim that survived will be dealt with at trial,\u201d said Ripple\u2019s Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty in an emailed statement. The plaintiff has alleged that Garlinghouse violated California\u2019s securities laws by professing to be \u201cvery, very long XRP\u201d while simultaneously selling \u201cmillions of XRP on various cryptocurrency exchanges\u201d throughout 2017. According to court documents, Ripple\u2019s lawyers argued that the claim should be tossed because XRP doesn\u2019t meet the definition of a security under the Howey Test and \u201cthus cannot give rise to a claim for misleading statements in connection with a security.\u201d In her Thursday ruling , Hamilton said that Ripple\u2019s lawyers urged her to \u201cfollow the reasoning\u201d of U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres who, in a parallel case in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), ruled that XRP did not meet all the prongs of the Howey Test when sold directly to retail participants on crypto exchanges. Torres\u2019 ruling constituted a partial victory for Ripple, and was celebrated by many in the crypto industry as a step in the right direction for long-awaited regulatory clarity, as well as a potential precedent for other crypto securities cases. But Torres\u2019 ruling hasn\u2019t seemed to have as much sway as hopefuls once thought it might. Last year, Torres\u2019 colleague in the SDNY, District Judge Jed Rakoff, rejected her ruling in a separate case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Singaporean crypto firm Terraform Labs. Hamilton, in her Thursday ruling, also broke with Torres\u2019 legal opinion that that XRP sold to \u201cprogrammatic\u201d (meaning non-institutional) traders was not a security because those traders had no expectation of profits due to the efforts of others, one of the four prongs of the Howey Test. \u201cThe court declines to find as a matter of law that a reasonable investor would have derived any expectation of profit from general cryptocurrency market trends, as opposed to Ripple\u2019s efforts to facilitate XRP\u2019s use in cross-border payments, among other things,\u201d Hamilton wrote. \u201cAccordingly, the [court] cannot find as a matter of law that Ripple\u2019s conduct would not have led a reasonable investor to have an expectation of profit due to the efforts of others.\u201d In his statement, Alderoty added that Torres\u2019 ruling in the SEC case \u201cstill stands.\u201d \u201cNothing here disturbs that decision,\u201d Alderoty wrote.

The noise from the Digihost facility has been polluting the North Tonawanda community for more than two years. Since then, residents said the city has done little, despite countless complaints, to enforce its noise ordinance against Digihost and give relief to those living around the facility. Joined by climate activists at a news conference Thursday morning, they called on the DEC to deny the air permit renewal for the Digihost plant on Erie Avenue. Digihost, a Canadian blockchain technology company that mines cryptocurrency, made its presence known in North Tonawanda in early 2022 when it began operating out of a plant formerly owned by Fortistar, which used it to burn natural gas. The plant\u2019s air permit expired in November 2021. After initially expressing concern over the arrival of the data mining operation, residents say they are dealing with loud noise emitting from the plant as it runs large fans to cool the supercomputers used to mine bitcoin. \u201cIf you think we\u2019re frustrated, imagine how the residents living up to a mile from this Digihost plant feel about the noise pollution that has disrupted their lives for more than two years,\u201d Deborah Gondek said as she addressed residents and members of the press. Deborah Gondek speaks to the media about the noise from a crypto mining operation. Gondek is a member of North Tonawanda's Climate Smart Task Force, a group that works to \u201caddress the impact of climate change through education, community building and measurable actions,\u201d according to its mission statement . She stressed that the noise pollution coming from the facility is equally as much a health concern as it is an annoyance, as consistent exposure to high-decibel noises increases the risk of hypertension, stroke and heart attack, along with being a detriment to mental health. City officials have been unable to force Digihost to quiet down due to their lack of proper equipment and training to enforce their noise ordinance. The Buffalo News reported that certified sound level meters cost between $250 and $500, a calibrator necessary to ensure the equipment is working properly costs another $500, and training to use the equipment could cost about $5,000 for eight to nine officers. Gondek said denying Digihost an air permit renewal would align with past actions of the DEC, referencing the 2022 denial of a renewal to Greenidge Generation in Dresden due to environmental concerns about the company\u2019s cryptocurrency mining operation near Seneca Lake. \u201cWith this precedent in place, we expect the DEC to be consistent and deny the air permit renewal for Digihost as soon as possible,\u201d she said. Many communities across New York have not yet adopted the regulations and zoning codes necessary to deal with bitcoin mining, including North Tonawanda. Because of this, Gondek said that she and Mayor Austin Tylec have drafted a two-year cryptocurrency moratorium for the city, which the Common Council will consider during a public hearing next month. Mark Polito, who moved to North Tonawanda in 2018 and lives about a mile from the Digihost plant, said the sound coming from the plant is constant, and that it \u201csounds very much like a jet taxiing up to a gate.\u201d \u201cAt night, it gets really loud when most people are trying to sleep,\u201d Polito said. \u201cDuring the day, it\u2019s loud enough to keep me out of my backyard. I never see my neighbors in their yards either.\u201d Polito said the noise also penetrates through the walls of his house into his living room, bedroom and bathroom, and often causes his pets to become distressed. \u201cIt\u2019s unlike anything my neighbors and I have heard from any other plant in the area for the 38 years that I\u2019ve been there,\u201d said Kevin O\u2019Connor, who said he lives just 900 feet from the plant. \u201cIt\u2019s nasty, it\u2019s constant, and it\u2019s aggravating. I need to talk over it in my own house.\u201d Multiple residents also expressed concern over the noise potentially causing a dip in their property values, and over harmful environmental impacts of the high levels of energy used in data mining operations. Bridge Rauch, an environmental justice organizer for the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York, said the DEC needs to step up its efforts in lowering emissions by increasing inspection efforts at plants like the one operated by Digihost. Homes on Fairmont Avenue in North Tonawanda. City residents have asked the state to help regulate noise from nearby Digihost. \u201cIt\u2019s being used for an industry that is not productive and doesn\u2019t contribute to the local economy,\u201d Rauch said of the plant. \u201cWe strongly encourage every Common Council member to right things this time around,\u201d Gondek said. \u201cTwo years is too long for residents to have to bear the brunt of past bad decisions by the North Tonawanda Planning Commission, Common Council and other city officials.\u201d Get local news delivered to your inbox!

Selkis, who runs the crypto data firm Messari, was among a couple of hundred attendees at an event celebrating Trump\u2019s series of nonfungible tokens, the digital collectibles known as NFTs. When he reached the lectern, Selkis turned to face the former President. \u201cThere\u2019s 50 million crypto holders in the US,\u201d the executive declared. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of voters.\u201d That message has become a political talking point in the crypto world, as the industry tries to shake off a wave of scandals and establish itself as a powerful force in the 2024 election cycle. Three large crypto firms have banded together to finance a group of affiliated super political action committees, investing about US$150 million to elect pro-crypto candidates in congressional races. The PACs are not planning to participate in the presidential election, a spokesperson for the groups said. But top crypto executives have tried to mobilise the industry behind Trump, who has reciprocated by praising digital currencies and hosting executives at Mar-a-Lago. Many crypto supporters view the 2024 election as a pivotal moment. After a series of crypto firms collapsed two years ago, the Biden administration embarked on an aggressive crackdown, bringing lawsuits and criminal charges against some of the industry\u2019s leading figures. The Securities and Exchange Commission is pursuing cases that could effectively force the crypto industry out of the United States. \u201cThe 2024 elections will be the most consequential in crypto\u2019s history,\u201d said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, a crypto company that has sparred with the federal government for years. \u201cYou are seeing a technology become a partisan political issue.\u201d Garlinghouse, Selkis and other executives have argued that newly energised \u201ccrypto voters\u201d could sway the outcome of the election. They often cite a survey, commissioned by crypto exchange Coinbase, that suggests that 52 million Americans own digital currencies. (The Federal Reserve estimates tthe total is 7% of the adult population, or roughly 18 million people.) But voters\u2019 supposed passion for crypto may be less important than the industry\u2019s campaign war chest. Ripple, Coinbase and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz have each donated about US$50 million to the crypto PACs, which plan to spend those funds in several competitive Senate races. In March, the largest PAC, Fairshake, spent about US$10 million on attack ads against Representative Katie Porter, a Democratic candidate in the California Senate primary who was allied with Senator Elizabeth Warren, a long-time crypto critic. Porter lost her race. \u201cA single, relatively small industry is literally trying to buy enough politicians to hijack the public agenda,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a financial reform advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty breathtaking.\u201d Related articles Is crypto the new quarter-acre dream? 11 Bitcoin ETFs approved: What it means for NZ investors Woman who wanted to be 'one of the biggest scammers in NZ' convicted over $17m crypto scam Crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years The industry\u2019s vast resources have turned a niche set of issues into a talking point in the presidential campaign. Robert F. Kennedy jnr, an independent presidential candidate, made his first official campaign appearance at a Bitcoin event in Miami, and he has attended multiple industry conferences, sometimes holding fundraising meetings with wealthy executives on the sidelines. President Joe Biden has long been seen as anti-crypto because his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Gary Gensler, has sued many crypto companies. But some Biden supporters, including investor Mark Cuban, have pressed his campaign to mend fences. The campaign has been receptive to the message, Cuban said in an email. In recent weeks, Biden officials have reached out to Coinbase and Ripple, asking to discuss crypto policy, four people familiar with those discussions said. Still, much of the industry appears to be coalescing around Trump. While the former President once said that Bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam\u201d and has frequently been critical of the tech industry, he has made several supportive comments about crypto over the past month, promising to end the regulatory crackdown. On Tuesday, Trump met at Mar-a-Lago with executives from some of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining companies, including Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms. Bitcoin should be \u201cMADE IN THE USA!!!\u201d he posted on his social network. The last time the crypto industry spent large sums on a political race, its top donor was Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, who spent tens of millions of dollars supporting both Democrats and Republicans in the 2022 mid-terms. Two years later, Bankman-Fried\u2019s company is bankrupt, and he\u2019s serving a 25-year prison sentence for fraud. The collapse of FTX was an enormous setback for the crypto industry\u2019s efforts in Washington. Last year, the SEC sued Coinbase and other crypto companies, arguing the digital assets they allowed customers to buy and sell were unregistered securities. In May, the industry notched a rare legislative victory when Congress voted to overturn an SEC accounting guideline that crypto companies had disputed. Biden vetoed the resolution. Now, the industry is fighting back. Fairshake has announced plans to participate in four other Senate races this year, including close contests in Ohio and Montana, where Democrats who have been critical of crypto are up for re-election. Privately, crypto executives have credited Fairshake with softening sceptical legislators, including Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat-Ohio, according to two people familiar with the conversations. Brown, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said in April he was open to advancing a bill that the industry supported. A few weeks after the California Senate primary in March, Representative Adam Schiff, the Democrat who defeated Porter, visited Coinbase\u2019s offices in Mountain View, California. He met with representatives from Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz and the crypto-focused investment firms Electric Capital, Paradigm and Haun Ventures, two people familiar with the meeting said. Trump has not always been a crypto supporter. He has said he preferred dollars to Bitcoin, and in 2019, he tweeted that digital currencies were \u201cbased on thin air\u201d. But lately, some crypto executives \u2014 in the market for a political saviour \u2014 have embraced him. Vivek Ramaswamy, a crypto enthusiast and former presidential candidate, has claimed credit for Trump\u2019s pivot on crypto and carved out a role as his emissary to the industry: on Wednesday afternoon, Ramaswamy met privately with Brian Armstrong, Coinbase\u2019s CEO, at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington and encouraged him to support the Trump campaign, a person familiar with the meeting said. Armstrong has not publicly endorsed a presidential candidate. \u201cWe will not give special treatment to one particular party,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cCrypto is a truly bipartisan issue.\u201d Selkis, who identifies as a libertarian, attended the Mar-a-Lago event in May after getting a ticket from a colleague who couldn\u2019t make it. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of eating my salad, and I get cold-called on the stage by the President,\u201d Selkis recalled in an interview. That night, Trump declared, \u201cIf you\u2019re in favour of crypto, you better vote for Trump.\u201d He has also announced his campaign would accept donations in digital currency and pledged to commute the life sentence of Ross Ulbricht, a cult hero in the crypto world who ran the online drug marketplace Silk Road. On Tuesday evening, Trump met with about 15 Bitcoin mining executives for over an hour at Mar-a-Lago, according to one of the attendees, Salman Khan, the chief financial officer at Marathon Digital. At one point, Khan said, the executives showed Trump the inside of a machine used for Bitcoin mining, an energy-guzzling process that has raised environmental concerns. \u201cHe liked the made-in-America feature to it,\u201d Khan said. Not everyone in the crypto world is on board with Trump. At a conference in May, Marvin Ammori, a Democrat who works for crypto firm Uniswap, debated Selkis on stage about the industry\u2019s political strategy, warning Trump might not follow through on his campaign promises. Still, this month, Trump attended a fundraiser at the San Francisco home of David Sacks, a prominent venture capitalist, and reiterated his support for crypto, according to three people who attended. Among the guests were Selkis, crypto executives Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, the people said. \u201cThe crypto vote has already been won by President Trump,\u201d Selkis said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Written by: David Yaffe-Bellany, Erin Griffith and Theodore Schleifer \u00a9 2024 THE NEW YORK TIMES Share this article Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 20:38:11", "image_url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/3UFXIQZII5HSPG7AT6V6ARPCJM.jpg?auth=aac42b9794c9b19359772c3b96fd127a5f8aa8049a843c8ad6efe4c32d16965e&width=300&height=300&smart=true&quality=70", "source_id": "nzherald", "source_priority": 7971, "source_url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/nzherald.jpg", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "economy,government", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_stats": "positive:72.49,neutral:26.15,negative:1.36"}, {"article_id": "9fb80b24c2ab5cea95de793a68e09963", "title": "US Treas Secretary Yellen says crytocurrency used in Fentanyl trafficking (only a little)", "link": "https://www.forexlive.com/Cryptocurrency/us-treas-secretary-yellen-says-crytocurrency-used-in-fentanyl-trafficking-only-a-little-20240620/", "keywords": "cryptocurrency", "creator": "Eamonn Sheridan,www.forexlive.com", "video_url": null, "description": "US Treasury Secretary Yellen:crytocurrency remains a small part of financing for Fentanyl trafficking This article was written by Eamonn Sheridan at www.forexlive.com.", "content": "US Treasury Secretary Yellen:", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 20:35:45", "image_url": "https://images.forexlive.com/images/Bitcoin%20doodle_id_01ade364-0717-4f63-97f1-aea2b329a127_size900.jpg", "source_id": "forexlive", "source_priority": 9087, "source_url": "https://www.forexlive.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons_crypto/forexlive.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "security & privacy,scam", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_stats": "positive:2.93,neutral:92.85,negative:4.22"}, {"article_id": "9f7be3935886ec94af8513201f619e1f", "title": "Gemini founders donate $1 million in bitcoin to Trump", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gemini-founders-donate-1-million-202120997.html", "keywords": null, "creator": "Reuters", "video_url": null, "description": null, "content": "(Reuters) - Winklevoss brothers, the founders of crypto currency exchange Gemini, said in a post on social media platform X on Thursday that they have donated $1 million in bitcoin to Donald Trump and will be voting for him in November. \"Over the past few years, the Biden Administration has openly declared war against crypto.

But this won\u2019t make the cryptocurrency any more useful for making payments, or remove the well-known risks.", "content": "While the sharemarket was captivated with the bumper float of Mexican fast-food chain Guzman y Gomez this week, there was some other financial news you may have missed. ASX investors not only gained the ability to buy shares in a burrito business, they also obtained a new way to punt on the price of bitcoin. In what will probably be the first of many such launches, fund manager VanEck unveiled a new ASX-listed exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will hold bitcoin as its underlying asset. The rise of bitcoin ETFs will give investors another way to bet on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price, but it won\u2019t remove the risks. Credit: Dionne Gain For the uninitiated, ETFs are a hugely popular type of investment fund that allow you to obtain exposure to an asset, or range of assets, at low cost. The rise of crypto ETFs means investors can buy in via an online share broker, rather than through a crypto exchange or other intermediary. Is this a big deal? Yes, and no. It\u2019s surely a milestone that the country\u2019s main stock exchange has accepted a crypto asset (the smaller Cboe exchange already hosts some crypto ETFs), following similar moves by stock exchanges overseas. If there were any doubts, this means bitcoin looks here to stay. However, at the same time, it doesn\u2019t remove any of the well-known risks of cryptos. Investing in a bitcoin ETF will remain highly risky because of the massive swings in the cryptocurrency\u2019s price \u2013 moves of 10 per cent a day are not uncommon, and bitcoin\u2019s price is up 50 per cent so far this year. What the rise of bitcoin ETFs should do is resolve the long-running question about whether the cryptocurrency is useful for making payments, or if its main appeal is for speculative trading. Surely, this must prove it\u2019s the latter. Cryptocurrencies \u2013 privately issued digital assets that operate separately from the banking system \u2013 aren\u2019t new. Bitcoin, the biggest crypto, is more than 15 years old; the first time it was used in the real world, it was to buy two pizzas . People from across the technology and financial world have spent years debating the usefulness of cryptocurrencies for as long as they\u2019ve been around. Could they challenge traditional money issued by commercial banks and central banks? Or is their main appeal that they might make you rich? The truth is no one knows how cryptos might eventually change the world of payments and money. That topic will probably be debated for decades and, throughout history, money has continually evolved. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies \u2013 some more useful and attractive than others. It\u2019s also important to separate bitcoin from the technology that sits beneath it \u2013 a \u201cdistributed ledger\u201d known as blockchain. Banks and other corporates have been exploring how blockchain technology could be used in all sorts of projects, such as \u201csmart payments,\u201d or cutting the cost of moving money around the world. Even so, the rise of bitcoin ETFs on the ASX supports the idea that cryptocurrencies\u2019 main appeal is as a speculative investment that tends to have wild price swings. These risks were brought home in the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX , which prompted regulators around the world to crack down on crypto operators, and sent global crypto prices tumbling. But bitcoin has more than recovered since then, hitting record highs this year. Packaging up bitcoin into an ETF should mean there are certain minimum standards about how the fund holds those assets. The ASX this week said each unit of the bitcoin ETF would correspond with a certain number of bitcoin. However, will it make crypto any less volatile as an investment? No \u2013 that\u2019s not the point. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission reminded investors of this fact this week, saying: \u201cASIC has repeatedly warned investors that crypto is risky, inherently volatile and complex. Investing in it is a highly speculative activity. Investors should only put in what they are prepared to lose.\u201d Many investors are more than happy to do this, of course. Self-managed super funds held $1 billion in crypto assets, according to figures published earlier this year, and banks have reported ongoing interest in crypto trading from their clients. To be fair, there\u2019s a chance some of these new forms of digital money \u2013 including central bank digital currencies \u2013 could help the financial world become more efficient in the long term. For common tasks such as moving money overseas, for example, the traditional banking system is still far too expensive. The Reserve Bank\u2019s head of payments policy Ellis Connolly this week said payments cost 5 per cent to 6 per cent of the transaction price on an overseas purchase. While Connolly didn\u2019t discuss digital currencies, they could eventually help to lower those costs. In the world of investing, innovations can also produce real benefits. The rise of ETFs is a case in point: These products are useful because they allow investors diversify across a wide range of assets at low cost. Bitcoin is simply the latest asset that ETFs are allowing people to invest in. One firm vying to release a new bitcoin ETF is Betashares, and it had separate news this week when it secured a $300 million investment from Singapore\u2019s giant sovereign wealth fund, Temasek, for an undisclosed stake. Betashares founder and chief executive Alex Vynokur says there was \u201cclear alignment\u201d with Temasek over the company\u2019s long-term goals, which include pushing further into superannuation, and ultimately, in using technology to help people make better investment decisions. Exactly what this would look like is unclear, but Vynokur says automation could be used to counter the emotions of \u201cfear and greed,\u201d which often detract from investment performance. \u201cHaving technology avoid some of the pitfalls of emotional investing I think is really powerful,\u201d Vynokur says. But is a bitcoin ETF an example of technology improving investing in a meaningful way? I don\u2019t think so. Rather, it\u2019s just a way of giving investors something else to bet on.

Real estate investing was significantly high for both groups of investors, but scored higher among the younger crowd ranking first. The biggest difference, outside of perhaps the crypto investments was the U.S. stocks. While investing in U.S. stocks ranked first among respondents aged 44 or older at 41%, the investment strategy was near the bottom for the 21-43 aged crowd getting only 14%. Seventeen percent of wealthy Americans aged 21 to 43 said they are investing alternative investments, compared to 5% of those 44 and older. The allocation is expected to rise in the coming years, with 93% of those aged 21 to 43 saying they would in the future and 20% of those aged 44 or older. When asked about specific alternative investment ideas, the younger audience favored: Watches (46%) Jewelry (39%) Rare automobiles (32%) Sneakers (30%) Sports cards (29%). The 44 and older crowd favored: Coins (27%) Jewelry (20%) Watches (19%). Only coins saw a higher percent from the older crowd than the younger crowd. Related Link: Gen Z Plans On Retiring Early, There Might Be A Key Reason Why Why It's Important: The survey found that 51% of the younger wealthy Americans said the U.S. economy was very good, compared to 24% of those aged 44 or older. Sixty-three percent of respondents believe the S&P 500 \u2014 tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY \u2014 will go higher in the next year. Twenty-seven percent of respondents say it will stay the same; 10% expect a decrease. Forty-eight percent of those polled see interest rates declining in the next year, while 21% see interest rates increasing. The poll shows that the younger wealthy Americans have been decreasing spending, paying off debt and delaying home sales due to higher rates. As the generations shift, it appears as if more investments will be made outside of traditional stocks. The caveat is the survey was only of those who have investable assets of $3 million or more. Investors with less capital may still avoid alternative investments and stick to traditional stocks.

Shkreli, who was convicted of securities fraud in 2017 after he hiked the price of a life-saving drug, said he was initially approached by an acquaintance of Barron Trump about making the coin, which has been branded DJT TrumpCoin. Rumors of possible links with the 45th president sent DJT TrumpCoin\u2019s value skyrocketing by 385% within 24 hours on Tuesday, and amassing a trading volume of $363 million. \u201cAbout three months ago I started working with two other guys, one of whom was a Trump family member to create Trump Coin,\u201d he claimed in a live stream on X , formerly known as Twitter. \u201cI was surprised. It was the president\u2019s son, [which] seems like a good idea,\u201d he said during the X Spaces event. \u201cHe wants to make money.\u201d The existence of the token \u201cTrump Coin\u201d was first reported by Fox Business on Monday after it was registered on the Solana blockchain platform. Shkreli said repeatedly throughout the X exchange that he had evidence of Barron Trump\u2019s involvement in the project that had eventually as many as 50 people working on it. Shkreli had first told online crypto investigator ZachXBT of how he worked with Donald Trump\u2019s youngest son to launch the coin. \u201cI have over 1000 pieces of evidence I created it with Barron,\u201d Shkreli wrote in that exchange. Nevertheless, Shkreli has not yet made public any of the proof linking Barron Trump to the coin that he purportedly has in his possession. Online sleuths had tried to unmask the creator of the DJT token after blockchain company Arkham Intelligence offered $150,000 to anyone who could successfully identify them. Donald Trump , the presumptive Republican nominee for this year\u2019s race for the White House, has not confirmed whether he or Truth Social is connected to the coin, which carries the same DJT symbol as his social media platform. The DJT coin\u2019s rally comes as investors continued to dump stock in parent company Trump Media, which fell by 15% after trading opened on the Nasdaq on Thursday to roughly $27 per share. The MAGA coin, a Trump token that is not affiliated to the 45th President, has plummeted by more than 20% since Tuesday, with a price of $6.82 per coin and a market value of just over $328 million. The Post has approached a Trump spokesperson and Truth Social for comment about Shkreli\u2019s claims. The 41-year-old Shkreli first became notorious in 2015 as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals when he ordered the price of the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim to be raised overnight by more than 4,000% to $750 per table He later served more than four years in prison following his 2017 conviction for defrauding investors in two hedge funds and scheming to defraud investors in another pharma firm. A court then banned him for life from the industry. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin created in 2009, are digital currencies that are not controlled by major financial institutions such as central banks. Their supporters argue this brings financial freedom, but their value can also be extremely volatile making a potentially risky asset for investors. Transactions are recorded and verified on a open source digital platform known as the blockchain. The system is similar to a virtual spreadsheet where every cryptocurrency trade is logged. By design, there is a cap of 21 million bitcoins that can be bought, and some 90% have already been mined. Last week, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the remainder of all available Bitcoins should be minted in the United States. It marks yet another U-turn for the presidential hopeful who told Fox Business in 2021 that the digital coin was \u201ca scam against the dollar.\u201d", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 17:43:35", "image_url": "https://nypost.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F2%2F2024%2F06%2Fmartin-shkreli-trump-coin.jpg?quality%3D90%26strip%3Dall%261718889315", "source_id": "nypost", "source_priority": 109, "source_url": "https://nypost.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/nypost.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "founders & investors,coin fundamental", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_stats": "positive:56.6,neutral:35.62,negative:7.78"}, {"article_id": "7f71af9f58a3a62ed3cae962bd5e0f85", "title": "Wealthy younger people are extremely interested in crypto and collectibles, not stocks", "link": "https://www.forexlive.com/news/wealthy-younger-people-are-destined-to-be-terrible-investors-20240620/", "keywords": "news", "creator": "www.forexlive.com,Adam Button", "video_url": null, "description": "Bank of America is out with a survey of wealthy investors but they divided them into two cohorts: Ages 21-43 and age 44+.

The ad campaign comes on top of tens of millions of dollars the crypto industry has already spent in U.S. elections this year, targeting down-ballot races to defeat those pushing for more regulation. The new ad from Coinbase aims to promote crypto alternatives to sending remittances, and features a young man who sends money to his grandmother in Mexico. Coinbase says that while the average fee rate to send money overseas is 6.18%, it is free to send that money with USD Coin, a digital stablecoin, on Coinbase Wallet. The ad will run on Univision during the Copa America soccer tournament on TV and digital with more investment in California and Texas, the company said. It is also targeting Washington, D.C. \"Our traditional financial system is not working for communities of color, who experience disproportionate barriers to wealth-building at every turn,\" said former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in a statement linked to the ad campaign.

Connor Farley from Truvius breaks down institutional investment trends, interests, perceptions, and how they have evolved over recent years. I\u2019d like to welcome a new contributor, Marissa Kim from Abra Capital Management, who provides insights in the Ask an Expert section about supporting client\u2019s investment interest in cryptocurrencies. - Sarah Morton You\u2019re reading Crypto for Advisors , CoinDesk\u2019s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. Since 2019, the crypto-focused subset of Fidelity\u2019s institutional business has published a survey called the \u201cInstitutional Investor Digital Assets Study,\u201d measuring trends in sentiment and adoption of crypto investing among institutional investors globally. Overall, the 2023 survey depicts a generally sturdy but still mixed institutional outlook toward crypto on the back of a turbulent 2022. Trends Reflecting Positive Sentiment Trends Reflecting Negative Sentiment It\u2019s important to note the latest survey only spans May 30, 2023, to Oct. 6, 2023, missing a critical year-end period during which bitcoin rose from approximately $28,000 to $42,300, driven largely by anticipation of the SEC\u2019s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs which occurred later, in January of 2024. Perceptions have likely evolved meaningfully since the start of 2024 following crypto\u2019s market capitalization climbing above $2.5 trillion, Bitcoin surging to nearly $74,000, and the SEC\u2019s approval of bitcoin and soon Ether spot ETFs. Arguably, the biggest market moments in the history of digital assets occurred after this survey was conducted, namely actions that reduce regulatory uncertainty, which may, in turn, reduce price volatility and improve investment options for investors. Will the surprise SEC approval of spot Ether ETFs diminish regulatory concerns among institutions? The digital asset market has begun transitioning from early adoption to mass adoption. A sea change in industry leadership, product development, and fiduciary commitment swept crypto in 2023 and early into 2024, enabling a new suite of increasingly institutional-grade on-ramps into the asset class. This change may take time to permeate through to institutional allocations more foundationally, but the rapid adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs following the SEC\u2019s approval (aggregate ETF AUM doubled from approximately $30 billion in January to nearly $60 billion as of mid-June) may provide early indications of stronger institutional interest in crypto. Will concerns about price volatility persist? Volatility for the digital asset class remains elevated compared to other asset classes, but it has trended down over time and may continue to do so as improving regulatory conditions and institution-friendly product offerings potentially stabilize markets. Investors should also consider not just crypto volatility but the risk-adjusted return profile of various blockchain assets. Will institutional investments flow primarily into spot BTC and ETH ETFs, or will they be spread across investment structures (SMAs, private funds, VC) offering diversified exposure to blockchain assets beyond the two mega caps? Supported by major advances in industry infrastructure in 2023 spanning custody, trading, and asset management, investors now have a better \u2013 but still nascent \u2013 array of product options and investment platforms to not only help avoid the pitfalls of early-adopter risk but also to exploit early-adopter premia. These options, in addition to ETFs, include the increasingly prevalent SMA direct-index vehicle. With the combined surge in blockchain data providers and the growing presence of systematic digital asset managers, will institutions become more familiar with crypto fundamentals and methods of digital asset valuation? Some 37% of 2023 respondents cited a \u201clack of fundamentals to gauge appropriate value\u201d as a barrier to investing. This large number reflects the asset class's emerging nature and the learning curve associated with measuring blockchain value. However, this number is down from 44% in 2021. It may continue to fall as investors become increasingly familiar with blockchain technology and the unique ways to analyze a protocol\u2019s value to users. - Connor Farley, CEO,Truvius Q: What else should I be thinking about aside from buying and holding Bitcoin? A: If clients want exposure to digital assets, it\u2019s advisable to diversify that exposure, as you would with traditional assets. Bitcoin should be the core of every portfolio. Still, consideration is increasingly being given to ETH and SOL, given that Ethereum is becoming the chain of choice for institutional applications and Solana is for consumer payment applications. Financial advisors should not leave their clients\u2019 assets on exchanges but utilize secure custody solutions to retain ownership and access to their client\u2019s assets. Q: Should I get exposure through ETFs? A: While ETFs are convenient for retail investors, they lack the flexibility and opportunities available from holding actual digital assets. Digital assets trade 24/7, unlike ETFs, which only trade during market hours. Moreover, ETFs do not enable yield generation, which can be an attractive income stream and cannot be used as collateral for borrowing. For clients with large BTC portfolios, borrowing against their digital assets may be preferable to selling and incurring capital gains tax. Q. Which client demographic are digital assets most suitable for? A: Understanding the suitability of digital assets requires assessing clients' risk tolerance and wealth management goals. For low-risk clients, digital assets may serve as a store of value, with opportunities to generate attractive yields through staking. High-risk clients may instead desire access to venture capital investments in early-stage blockchain projects or higher-yielding DeFi investment strategies. Tailoring these approaches to individual needs helps integrate digital assets into a comprehensive wealth management plan. - Marissa Kim, head of Asset Management, Abra Capital Management Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

On June 6, the two parties said they have an agreement for Robinhood to buy Bitstamp in an approximately $200 million deal. The deal is expected to close in early 2025 and will expand Robinhood\u2019s global reach as well as its prominence in the crypto space. Details of the Deal Robinhood has much to gain from its acquisition of Bitstamp. Bitstamp holds more than 50 active licenses and registrations to operate as a crypto exchange across a number of countries and will greatly expand Robinhood\u2019s crypto footprint. As part of the strategic combination, Robinhood will gain access to Bitstamp\u2019s customer base, which spans the European Union, United Kingdom, Asia and the United States. Bitstamp also has a strong institutional client base, which Robinhood has historically lacked. \u201cThe deal accelerates Robinhood\u2019s international expansion, instantly giving it access to international institutional crypto clients without having to go through the arduous licensing processes across Europe and Asia,\u201d says Drayton D\u2019Silva, CEO and chief investment officer at Tower Hills Capital. \u201cIt also gives Robinhood revenue diversification.\u201d Robinhood expects the deal to be worth roughly $200 million in cash. However, that number could fluctuate somewhat as it is still subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Both parties are anticipating the deal to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Robinhood used Barclays Capital exclusively as its financial advisor, and Galaxy Digital Partners exclusively acted as Bitstamp\u2019s financial advisor. Robinhood\u2019s Crypto Business Founded in 2013, Robinhood is arguably the best known investing app. The trading platform rose to popularity due to its commission-free trading and easy-to-use interface. However, it has also faced criticism over the years for \u201cgamifying\u201d investing and for its practice of payment for order flow. Robinhood\u2019s first foray into the crypto industry came in 2018, when the platform rolled out commission-free trading of bitcoin and Ethereum. Since then, Robinhood has expanded its crypto offerings, adding many other cryptocurrencies to its trading platform. It debuted a crypto wallet in 2022. More recently, crypto has played a significant role in Robinhood\u2019s profitability and success. In the first quarter of 2024, the company attributed much of its record revenue to a 232% increase in revenue from cryptocurrency transactions. As the company aims to further expand its crypto offerings, it makes sense that it would look to acquire an established cryptocurrency exchange. Bitstamp, which was founded in 2011, is among the oldest crypto exchanges . It is known for its user-friendly platform and reasonable trading fees that make it an attractive choice for beginner crypto investors. The State of the Crypto Industry After acquiring Bitstamp, Robinhood will likely gain market share from major competitors like Coinbase . This comes at a time when the crypto winter seems to be in a thaw. Many regulators and politicians appear to be softening their resistance to cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds , or ETFs. More recently it took the first step toward approving spot Ethereum ETFs as well. That marked a significant reversal in sentiment toward cryptocurrencies from the SEC. Now, Robinhood\u2019s acquisition of Bitstamp is the latest piece of news indicating that the crypto industry is moving toward greater mainstream acceptance. \u201cFor the wider crypto market, this deal could have several impacts. First, it could boost mainstream adoption and trust in cryptocurrencies, as more people see a well-known brand like Robinhood getting deeper into crypto. This might increase confidence among investors who were hesitant to dive in,\u201d says Michael Baynes, co-founder and CEO of Clarify Capital. \u201cSecond, it could push other financial platforms to improve their crypto services, leading to more innovation and competition. This, in turn, could result in better services and more options for users.\u201d Investors should keep an eye out as this deal moves forward. Time will show to what extent this deal makes Robinhood a major player in the crypto space\u2014and what it means for the broader crypto industry. According to Baynes, \u201cThe overall success of this acquisition will depend on how well Robinhood integrates the new platform and meets the needs of crypto investors.\u201d Best Crypto Exchanges 2024 We've combed through the leading exchange offerings, and reams of data, to determine the best crypto exchanges.", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 15:05:42", "image_url": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/900x510/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Good-News-For-Crypto-Robinhood-Bets-Big-On-Cryptocurrency-With-Bitstamp-Deal-Cropped-1.jpg", "source_id": "forbes", "source_priority": 57, "source_url": "https://www.forbes.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/forbes.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "founders & investors,adoption", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_stats": "positive:81.3,neutral:18.34,negative:0.36"}, {"article_id": "15fa542138d9452a40d4c2b01d3aa2c4", "title": "MicroStrategy just bought another $800 million worth of Bitcoin", "link": "https://qz.com/microstrategy-acquires-12-000-more-bitcoin-for-800-mil-1851550513", "keywords": "michael saylor,michael j saylor,cryptocurrencies,microstrategy,business finance,bitcoin,economics of bitcoin", "creator": "Vinamrata Chaturvedi", "video_url": null, "description": "MicroStrategy stock jumped nearly 2.5% to $1,504 shortly after the market opened on Thursday as the company acquired another 11,931 Bitcoin for nearly $786 million.

It's not unusual for Meta to be sued, but this case is a bit different. An Australian billionaire mining magnate has won the right to sue the social media giant over scam crypto and investment advertisements that appeared on Facebook featuring his likeness. Andrew Forrest wrote an open letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the ads in 2019. \"You have the power and the technology to prevent these scam advertisements from running on your platform,\" he said, asking Zuckerberg if revenue was more important to the company than the life savings of elderly people. Forrest tried to launch legal action against Meta in Australia over the scam crypto and investment ads, but the Director of Public Prosecutions filed a discontinuance motion in April due to insufficient evidence. Forrest had sued under Australian laws that let individuals criminally prosecute foreign companies upon receiving prosecutors' consent. Andrew Forrest isn't a fan of Facebook Forrest also brought a lawsuit against Meta in the US. On Monday, US District Judge Casey Pitts in San Jose, California, rejected Meta Platforms' bid to dismiss. As per The Reg , Forrest alleges that Meta had misappropriated his name and likeness, negligently breached its duty to the general public by allowing the scam ads to run, failed to warn users, unjustly enriched itself, and relied on the US Communications Decency Act as a defense. The court dismissed three of the arguments but said the misappropriation and breach of duty arguments were adequately pleaded. \"Dr Forrest claims that Meta profited more from ads that included his likeness than it would have if the ads had not,\" Pitts wrote. \"This is enough to adequately plead that the alleged misappropriation was to Meta's advantage.\" Meta had tried to argue that Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act prevents platforms from being held responsible for content posted by users. The judge said Forrest's claims \"present a factual dispute regarding whether Meta's ad systems were neutral tools that anyone could use (or misuse) or whether the tools themselves contributed to the content of the ads.\" Forrest said the decision marks the first time a social media company has not been able to hide behind Section 230 in a US civil case over its advertising business. Forrest called the decision a \"crucial strategic victory in the battle to hold Facebook accountable.\" As Australia's second-richest person, Forrest's $16 billion net worth means he has the resources to go up against a tech giant like Meta. He said more than 1,000 of the ads appeared on Facebook in Australia between April and November 2023, resulting in millions of dollars in losses for victims.

Benchmark's analyst Mark Palmer wrote that the stock had gained more than 330% since the beginning of May; it then lost almost half of its value over two days before recovering much of that loss yesterday afternoon. Most of the ETPs that DeFi offers are altcoin focused, and the slump in these tokens earlier in the week had a negative impact on the share price, Palmer said. The pullback might be partially due to traders taking some profit off the table after the recent outsized rally, but the sell-off appears overdone, and the stock\u2019s significant repricing offers an \u201cattractive buying opportunity,\u201d the report added.

But what if it is already here? I argue that Telegram and a handful of independent developers have made more progress in onboarding the masses to crypto than the $100 billion in venture capital that has flooded the space since 2014. Crypto adoption has been hindered by (i) poor UX, (ii) limited real-world utility, and (iii) terrible distribution. Through its support for and integration of The Open Network (TON), Telegram is addressing all of these issues and more. Throughout its early development and up until recently, crypto focused on niche tech development that primarily served crypto speculators and lacked real-world utility. With the arrival of spot ETFs and firms such as BlackRock opening up funds focused on asset tokenization, the time for evolution is now. Telegram combined its messaging app boasting 800 million monthly active users, a blockchain providing rails for crypto adoption in TON, and a native wallet bot known simply as Wallet. Many crypto pitch decks vaguely romanticize the notion of \u201cmerging Web2 and Web3,\u201d Telegram is actually doing it. With this combination, Telegram addresses the three core issues that held crypto back. In my view, stablecoins are crypto\u2019s greatest product to date. With native USDT on TON since April, the seamless transfer of value P2P became a reality. Users can send crypto to their friends as easily as sending a message on WhatsApp. This is a smoother UX than neobanks like Venmo or Revolut, and lightyears ahead of traditional banks. The opportunity for onboarding 100s of millions to crypto, however, likely comes through Telegram\u2019s Mini Apps \u2014 an open platform for businesses to build and deploy crypto-friendly apps. This will enable crypto teams to distribute their product to non-crypto-natives while the end user will not necessarily know they are using a crypto product \u2014 whether that is a fun mobile game or a DeFi protocol. Telegram solidified its place in crypto long ago. It is a popular platform among crypto natives used to keep in touch or share ideas, and it is usually the first social media channel new crypto projects set up along with their X account. Recently, it became more than that for on-chain traders. A new generation of Telegram trading bots changed crypto UX forever, and perhaps changed on-chain trading forever. Buying/selling, setting limit orders, scanning new projects, sniping new launches, and copy trading \u201csmart money,\u201d all became simple with a single command. Having a Telegram bot comprehensively freeing me from the most frustrating UX issues of on-chain trading was a breath of fresh air. It was one of the very rare times a crypto product made me say \u201cwow, this is great.\u201d It did, however, make altcoin trading much more competitive and spurred on what I consider the \u201cproliferation of altcoins.\u201d Read more: TON-Based Economy Starting to Take Root in Telegram, TON Foundation Says Does this mean altcoin trading/investing is dead? Far from it. The ease with which newcomers can now interact with smart contracts compared with what I had to do starting out is night-and-day. This, combined with distribution and increasingly useful apps means a new wave of capital flowing into crypto over the coming years. The improvement we have here in UX cannot be overstated. I say this because I have myself onboarded non-crypto friends through TON's Wallet. Prior to Telegram\u2019s current infrastructure, I would let out a small sigh at the prospect of trying to teach a friend how to use crypto. Now, thanks to Telegram, I do not see how it could be easier. So that\u2019s it, Telegram and TON have won, right? Not quite. The improvement in UX and distribution is a big leap forward, but we have yet to see a comprehensive range of consumer-facing apps. Mini apps are being developed and there is a major incentive for game devs to build a fun Telegram game that captures the attention of its huge user base. Alas, what exists now is more meme-based than utility-based. Regulations also remain a concern, but that is an ongoing industry-wide issue not isolated to Telegram or TON. Telegram and TON have a lot to do, but I believe they will pull it off. The market seems to be pricing this in now, as $TON has already reached the top-10 crypto list in market cap. $TON\u2019s run has largely been fueled by fervent speculation we are so familiar with, but there are real fundamentals to back up a lot of its growth. Most of us want to see a future where crypto is being used by the masses. This sentiment is shared by Telegram\u2019s co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov, who is a major Bitcoin advocate.

This penalty was disclosed in a statement from the FIU, which was obtained by Naija News on Thursday. The Indian authorities stated that Binance violated three sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, by operating as an unregistered entity within the country. This development adds to Binance\u2019s ongoing legal issues, as it is also under trial in Nigeria for money laundering and tax evasion. Recall that in Nigeria, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) accused Binance of laundering over $35 million through its platform. Additionally, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has filed a separate case against the exchange for tax evasion. Binance registered with India\u2019s FIU in May, attempting to resume operations after receiving a show-cause notice from the financial watchdog in December 2023. However, the exchange\u2019s failure to comply with regulations resulted in the substantial fine. The FIU\u2019s document stated: \u201c 1. Binance, by operating as a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider (VDA SP) under Section 2(sa)(vi) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is considered a reporting entity under Section 2(1)(wa) of the Act. \u201c2. Due to Binance\u2019s ongoing service provision to Indian clients without fulfilling its statutory obligations under the PMLA, a notice dated December 28, 2023, was issued, compelling Binance to explain why action should not be taken against it for its non-compliance. \u201c3. After reviewing Binance\u2019s written and oral submissions, the Director of FIU-IND determined that the charges were substantiated.

Tokenizing traditional assets is a growing trend among financial institutions, and many other organizations have started holding bitcoin and adding it to their balance sheets.

What is an ETF? An ETF is a type of investment fund and exchange-traded product that is traded on stock exchanges, much like . The announcement of the ETH Spot ETF is a significant event for Ethereum and the broader crypto market because it provides a regulated and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to ETH, even institutional investors. Market reaction on Spot Bitcoin ETF approval The market's reaction to the approval of the Spot Bitcoin ETF was highly positive. with Bitcoin's price seeing a substantial increase. This approval set a precedent and boosted investor confidence in cryptocurrency ETFs. Similarly, the approval of the Gold ETF in the past led to a significant rise in gold prices. The availability of such investment vehicles can positively impact asset prices by making them more accessible to a broader range of investors. Impact on institutional and retail investors Institutional investors have shown a marked increase in their allocation to Ethereum. Bybit reports that these investors have tripled their ETH holdings, demonstrating growing confidence in Ethereum's potential. This shift in allocation is driven by the anticipation that the ETH Spot ETF will attract even more investment into Ethereum, positively affecting its price and market capitalization. Institutional investors typically seek stability and long-term growth, and their increased exposure to ETH suggests a strong belief in its future performance. Retail investors (non-institutional traders) are also showing increased interest in Ethereum. The announcement of the ETH Spot ETF has made Ethereum more attractive to individual investors who may have been hesitant to invest in cryptocurrencies. The ETF offers a simplified and regulated way to invest in ETH. As a result, the increased demand from both institutional and retail investors is expected to drive up the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency. Conclusion Bybit's report shows that institutional investors have tripled their ETH exposure after the announcement of Ethereum spot ETF. The increased interest is shared by retail investors as well. The ETF provides a regulated and accessible way for a wider range of investors to invest in Ethereum, which is expected to boost its market value significantly.

The bitcoin price has rocketed since the devastating collapse of the major bitcoin and crypto exchange FTX in late 2022, . Now, after wild speculation this week that the Trump campaign could be behind a new, viral cryptocurrency, a series of leaks have torpedoed the claims\u2014crashing the price of the bitcoin rival. \u2014 Former U.S. president Donald Trump has surprised many with his embrace of bitcoin and crypto this On Monday, a cryptocurrency called trumpcoin and using ticker DJT was linked to Trump by the media company , created and led by Mike Solana, who is also a vice president at Peter Thiel's venture capital company Founders Fund. \"Per conversations, Trump is launching an official token\u2014DJT,\" the X account , adding that Trump's 18-year-old son Barron is \"spearheading.\" Solana reposted the claim, it a \"scoop\" and adding he \"didn't speak with Trump directly, assumed this was clear. Just reporting what I know via sources.\" The price of DJT, which launched just two months ago, surged around 300% following the claim, with traders betting the price could climb far higher if it was confirmed Trump's campaign was really behind it. However, after denying he was involved, outrage entrepreneur Martin Shkreli has admitted in leaked messages sent to pseudonymous blockchain sleuth ZachXBT and then on an X spaces broadcast that he's behind the DJT memecoin\u2014crashing its price. Shkreli, a convicted pharmaceutical executive who hit the headlines for hiking drug prices almost 10 years ago and earning himself the moniker \"pharma bro,\" has become a crypto influencer since his 2022 release. \"I have 1000 pieces of evidence I created it with [Trump's son] Barron,\" Shkreli, who had directly denied being involved with the memecoin, wrote to ZachXBT in a message. ZachXBT has accepted a $150,000 bounty for the identity of the DJT creator offered by crypto analytics company Arkham Intelligence. Meanwhile, a Trump campaign \"insider\" denied it has had any involvement. Shkreli has, however, continued to claim he created the bitcoin rival in collaboration with Trump\u2019s youngest son Barron, adding during an X spaces broadcast that Barron holds the majority of the cryptocurrency and is the sole beneficiary of the project. Trump has leaned into bitcoin and crypto in recent weeks after making millions from a series of crypto-based digital trading card non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and putting him starkly at odds with the Biden administration's anti-crypto stance. Trump declared support for crypto in late May and began accepting campaign donations in bitcoin, ethereum, solana, dogecoin and shiba inu. The bitcoin price has rocketed back to its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin this year Earlier this month, Trump reportedly went on a crypto charm offensive during a Silicon Valley fundraiser hosted by investors David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, it was by . \"He said he would be the crypto president,\" Trevor Traina, a San Francisco-based tech executive and former Trump ambassador to Austria, was quoted by the newswire.

David Bailey, the chief executive of who has claimed to be advising the Trump 2024 election campaign on bitcoin and crypto, warned that if the claim is wrong, it could spook Trump and cause him to back away from crypto. \"If the DJT Solana meme coin is fake, whoever propagated that needs to be tarred and feathered and chased out of our industry for good,\" Bailey to X. \"This is how you make the whole industry look [bad] and signal to the president and his team we're a liability not an asset.\"", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 12:41:00", "image_url": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66741edfd1ba702f0c047d5b/0x0.jpg?width=960", "source_id": "forbescrypto", "source_priority": 57, "source_url": "https://www.forbes.com/crypto-blockchain/?sh=63e42a162b6e", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons_crypto/forbescrypto.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "sentiments,scam", "sentiment": "negative", "sentiment_stats": "positive:0.43,neutral:4.82,negative:94.75"}, {"article_id": "63f0836b0e4cc6a46520c174c9a283b3", "title": "Kenya Halts Worldcoin Investigation, Mandates Legal Registration for Sam Altman", "link": "https://www.gadgets360.com/cryptocurrency/news/worldcoin-probe-stop-kenya-sam-altman-register-business-legally-5931761", "keywords": "cryptocurrency", "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) in Kenya has claimed that an array of allegations related to Worldcoin\u2019s user data collection were \u2018expeditiously and objectively\u2019 investigated.

The project aims to provide blockchain-based universal proof-of-personhood to humans called \u2018World IDs'. By giving this unique identity to humans, Worldcoin aims to eliminate the need for humans to give their personal details to interact with bots and the web. As a mark of human identity, Worldcoin officials were collecting eye scans through an in-house device called the Orb \u2013 which raised concerns around user data privacy in many countries. What remains unclear for now is if Kenya has given a green flag to Worldcoin operations by shutting probe over it. This may impact the ongoing investigations into the project in other nations like South Korea, Germany, and Brazil. The project had faced scrutiny in India also last year and had to halt its iris scanning process.

And notably, meme cryptos have been all the rage over the past few months. Most big-cap cryptos have delivered boring price action. Additionally, many flashy altcoin projects have started to plateau and decline once again. I personally think that many altcoins have very attractive entry points right now before the next leg higher in this bull market. Accordingly, many with higher risk tolerance profiles may want to consider allocating some portion of one\u2019s portfolio to these assets. Now, meme cryptos carry significantly higher risk than many of the more established crypto projects out there. Accordingly, it\u2019s been my view that investors should only put money they\u2019re willing to lose into these projects. Indeed, there are plenty of \u201cpump & dump\u201d schemes to be wary of right now. Plus, many meme cryptos provide nothing in the way utility and just trade on simply momentum and hype, so it is almost impossible to judge their price action. Even then, if you think it is worth putting some money into some up-and-coming meme cryptos, here are three lottery ticket tokens to look into. Non-Playable Coin (NPC-USD) Non-Playable Coin ( NPC-USD ) is a meme coin and NFT hybrid for all 8+ billion humans on Earth. The project\u2019s token supply is set to the total human population as recorded on 26 July 2023, with each token convertible to an NFT at a rate of 1:1. Inspired by the non-playable character meme, the ERC-20 token leans into the joke by creating a supply limited to the total human population. NPC has been one of the meme cryptos with the most bullish price action recently. The crypto has gained 284% over just the past month alone. And there are plenty of crypto experts and talking heads who believe NPC could soar even higher from here. I think that\u2019s definitely possible, since the market capitalization of this project currently sits at just $140 million . We\u2019ve seen many memecoins break the $1 billion barrier this cycle, so if the team continues to \u201cshill\u201d this crypto, NPC could join that list. Non-Playable Coin does not currently provide any utility, and is for entertainment purposes only. However, users will soon be able to accessorise their NPCs using a built-in customisation tool, with plans to better link the liquidity of ERC-20 tokens with ERC-1155 tokens. BEFE (BEFE-USD) BEFE ( BEFE-USD ) is a much smaller meme crypto. This is a project with a market capitalization of just $25 million . But that\u2019s not to say there hasn\u2019t been plenty of excitement around this token\u2019s price action in recent days. The triple-digit swings here are bringing in a lot of attention. BEFE was launched with no presale, and has zero taxes, making it a coin \u201cfor the people,\u201d according to its promoters. The only big centralized exchange BEFE currently trades on is MEXC . I think if the meme crypto manages to get listed on bigger exchanges, that market capitalization could definitely start climbing higher. I would also note that this project is quite old compared to most hyped-up meme coins we\u2019re seeing proliferate. BEFE did have an initial surge back in December 2023, but has since traded lower since April of this year before its recent resurgence. For those betting on a continued meme coin rally, this is a project to watch closely. PepeFork (PORK-USD) Pepe ( PEPE-USD ) is a meme token that has been really popular in the current cycle, even managing to break through the key $1 billion market cap threshold. Thus, it should be no surprise there have been many rebranded Pepe tokens coming out over the past few months, with some reaching hundreds of millions in market cap. PepeFork ( PORK-USD ) is one such project. However, this token\u2019s market capitalization has recently declined to $73 million . That said, PORK\u2019s price did bounce 35% over the past week. So, I think there could be a possibility of this meme coin bouncing higher and making a resurgence. This is a meme coin forked from the original Pepe coin to improve transparency and community-driven development. PORK is the native token of the PepeFork ecosystem, with a total supply of 420.69 trillion tokens. I think the price of this crypto depends more on how most other Pepe tokens are going to perform. But it\u2019s one meme coin investors may want to consider for amplified upside during this cycle.

Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company as of the end of April held 214,400 bitcoins. This latest acquisition brings the company's total holdings to 226,331 tokens worth just under $15 billion at bitcoin's current price of roughly $66,000. The company's bitcoins were purchased at an average price of $36,798 each, or roughly $8.33 billion. This most recent purchase followed the company's $800 million convertible note offering to institutional investors. That offering size was originally to be for $500, then raised to $700M and finally closed at $800M . In March, the company added 9,245 BTC for $623 million after raising money in a similar debt issuance. Saylor and MicroStrategy started accumulating the largest and oldest cryptocurrency in 2020 and since have attempted to spearhead a movement to adopt BTC as a reserve asset for other corporate treasuries. While a handful of companies have added modest amounts of bitcoin to their balance sheet, of particular note is U.S.-listed Semler Scientific (SMLR), which over the past three weeks has not only added bitcoin as a relatively sizable treasury asset, but \u2013 in similar fashion to MicroStrategy \u2013 is attempting to tap capital markets to buy bitcoin in amounts far larger than what its current market cap might indicate. MicroStrategy shares have risen roughly ten-fold since the firm's bitcoin purchases began four years ago. Semler shares are higher by more than 60% since the company disclosed its first bitcoin buys in late May. Last week, brokerage firm Bernstein initiated coverage of Microstrategy, setting a $2,890 price target for the company's shares with an outperform rating. MSTR is currently up 2% premarket to $1,507.

Accordingly, many investors are starting to exit positions in some of the top altcoins. Whether this is a good move or not will be proven over time. But I do think it is a good time to cash in on this recent volatility, and accumulate some decent projects before the market potentially turns bullish again. I believe this reversal could happen in late-2024 or early-2025, once rate cuts line up with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) scarcity increasing after the halving\u2019s impact fully kicks in. Bitcoin has historically taken months after its halving events to make big moves. I think something similar could happen again, even though the recently-approved spot Bitcoin ETFs have already pushed this token to an all-time high. If you think the rest of the crypto market will bounce back along with Bitcoin in the coming months, you should consider taking a look at the following projects. Ethereum (ETH-USD) Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has been pretty disappointing this cycle. The token\u2019s gains have kept up with Bitcoin, but they are in no way as outstanding as they were in previous cycles. This is the biggest altcoin out there, and if we sum up all ERC20 tokens, Ethereum is a massive ecosystem with a market capitalization that could challenge Bitcoin\u2019s during altseason surges. However, Ethereum has failed to meaningfully outperform Bitcoin of late. I think the biggest reason behind this is the fact that spot Ethereum ETFs are yet to go trade on the open market. That said, there is some good news on this front. Recently, Coinpedia reported that \u201csenior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, speaking to Bloomberg , indicated that the SEC\u2019s comments on the S-1 filings were relatively minor, hinting at a possible approval by July 2. Despite this, the SEC has not specified an exact approval timeline beyond stating it will occur sometime this summer, contingent on issuer responses.\u201d If this approval does go through, I expect hedge funds to start piling into Ethereum like they did with Bitcoin earlier this year. Plus, rate cuts should naturally lead to higher prices for Ethereum and other tokens. Institutions and individual investors would have a greater incentive to stake Ethereum for relatively high yields as interest rates drop further. Solana (SOL-USD) Solana ( SOL-USD ) will likely be next in line as a spot ETF candidate. This is one of the only layer-1 chains that has remained relevant in the previous cycle and this cycle as well. Notably, Solana has also proved that it can compete with Ethereum in many niche crypto sectors as well. Solana has a sizable market share when it comes to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) , and it also has an ecosystem that memecoin traders find very appealing due to its low fees. I think the biggest upside potential here actually comes from Ethereum. If Ethereum sees a lot of action in its blockchain and gas (or transaction fees) begin to increase, plenty of traffic could be driven to the Solana ecosystem. We have seen this play out many times in the past, so I believe using Ethereum\u2019s growth as a yardstick for Solana\u2019s upside makes sense. Plus, the team has also reduced network downtime quite a lot, so I see Solana as an ecosystem that could provide strong growth going forward. Render (RNDR-USD) Render ( RNDR-USD ) is a much more speculative bet right now. The Render Token could serve as \u201cdigital fuel\u201d for AI models that require ever-increasing rendering power. This crypto projects allows users to sell their computing power to the blockchain, which others can buy in bulk using RNDR tokens. Notably, Render has seen a lot of success among companies and individuals who do not have the money to spend on hardware, or simply want a decentralized and cheap way to render their projects. I think institutions could also jump in en-masse, given the fact that AI GPU prices have been going vertical. GPUs used in rendering are also going to get more expensive after OpenAI releases its Sora text-to-video AI model and people start using it. Thus, for those who believe in the strong long-term tailwinds supporting rendering activity, this is a top project to consider right now.

The biggest problem with technicalanalysis is that you don\u2019t know what level may actually hold and therefore youmay get stopped out many times before getting it right or you may not even getthe chance to enter because the market just keeps going. The second way is byusing catalysts in line with your fundamental bias. In fact, a catalyst notonly brings more volume but it also gives the market a reason to go into acertain direction. Traders can either execute their trades in line with the catalyst or fade the reaction and enter at better prices if they deem it wrong-footed.

A negative piece of news in a bull market will be seen like a drop in the ocean unless it changes completely the future expectations. Two ways to time the market There are generally two ways to time the market: oneis via technical analysis and the other is via catalysts. The biggest problem with technicalanalysis is that you don\u2019t know what level may actually hold and therefore youmay get stopped out many times before getting it right or you may not even getthe chance to enter because the market just keeps going. The second way is byusing catalysts in line with your fundamental bias. In fact, a catalyst notonly brings more volume but it also gives the market a reason to go into acertain direction. Traders can either execute their trades in line with the catalyst or fade the reaction and enter at better prices if they deem it wrong-footed.", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 12:04:32", "image_url": "https://images.forexlive.com/images/Trading%20Catalyst_id_46df2453-c3de-4b0d-b673-80755dcc3af3_size50.jpg", "source_id": "forexlive", "source_priority": 9087, "source_url": "https://www.forexlive.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons_crypto/forexlive.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "general", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_stats": "positive:2.33,neutral:97.22,negative:0.45"}, {"article_id": "7808bba6f4ba1e5c782389606d91bd17", "title": "First Mover Americas: Crypto Assets Rally With BTC Returning to $66K", "link": "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/20/first-mover-americas-crypto-assets-rally-with-btc-returning-to-66k/", "keywords": "first mover,markets,news,ether,bitcoin", "creator": "Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole", "video_url": null, "description": "The latest price moves in bitcoin (BTC) and crypto markets in context for June 20, 2024.

Italy set up mandatory registration requirement for crypto company operating in the nation but approved 73 firms as virtual currency service providers without running proper checks to make sure they are safe for investors, CoinDesk reported previously. Optimism about crypto in Italy has been reflected by moves such as one from Conio, a cryptocurrency wallet company, which teamed up with Coinbase (COIN) to bring digital assets to Italian banks and financial institutions.

Traditionally, Israelis have focused on real estate, both domestically and internationally, and stock markets. However, the expanding availability of investment funds in Israel has led individuals to explore various investment opportunities. The rise in interest rates has simplified the process of investing money and has yielded favorable returns. Before this shift, attracted considerable attention. Bitcoin's value soared from around $40,000 to $70,000, making it increasingly appealing to investors. Governments worldwide are starting to recognize various and incorporating them into traditional investment channels. However, regulatory frameworks are still catching up with new technologies, leading to instances of fraud that have affected some investors. Bitcoin was founded in 2008 by an individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto and was first used in 2009. Unlike traditional currencies governments issue, Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority, such as a central bank. Instead, transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded on the blockchain. One of Bitcoin's key features is its limited supply; there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence. This scarcity is designed to prevent inflation and maintain the currency's value over time. Government attitudes toward Bitcoin vary significantly around the world. Some countries have embraced Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, recognizing their potential for innovation and economic growth. In Israel, the attitude toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has been somewhat mixed, with regulatory initiatives and a growing interest in the technology. A leading Israeli tech company in this space is Bits of Gold, which has been active since 2013. It operates under the compliance and approval of the Finance and the Capital Market Authority, Insurance, and Savings Authority. Its platform is known for its simplicity and security, offering a reliable option for those interested in digital currency investments. One challenge when purchasing crypto is transferring it to your bank account; Israeli banks sometimes block such transfers, especially if the funds originated from digital currencies. However, transfers from supervised bodies like Bits of Gold are more comfortable and organized. Bits of Gold addresses this issue by managing the tax on the interest you earn, sparing you from dealing directly with tax authorities. Additionally, transactions can be conducted in US dollars, eliminating the need for currency conversion fees from . The company offers customer support in English and Hebrew to answer relevant questions about managing and selling your currencies, which is particularly important for new customers.

Tether Ltd, the issuer of tether (USDT), the world's leading dollar-pegged cryptocurrency by market value, alone holds around $91 billion in Treasuries and Circle, the issuer of USDC, holds short-dated U.S. debt, including repos, worth $29 billion, according to Tagus Capital. Coincidentally, of the many crypto bills in the U.S. political corridors, stablecoin legislation has been the closest to moving past the U.S. Congress to become law. Hopes that the U.S. will get a new stablecoin law before the elections this year remain. In April, key congressman Patrick McHenry was bullish that the U.S. would have a stablecoin law by the end of the year. However, attempts to include a stablecoin regulation in an unrelated must-move reauthorization bill failed. McHenry later told CoinDesk that \u201cwe\u2019re so close on this, we just need a legislative calendar, so that we can get things across the finish line in the Senate.\u201d He also echoed the sentiment of the Majority Whip in the House of Representatives, Republican Tom Emmer who suggested that the lame duck session, might be the opportune time to attach a legislation to a must-pass bill. A lame duck session occurs in the transition period after elections before the president-elect takes over in January 2025. The U.S. government debt surpassed the $34 trillion mark early this year and has been growing faster, roughly $1 trillion every 100 years. Interest payments on the debt, also known as the debt-servicing cost, are projected to reach $892 billion in 2024 . The burgeoning debt has caused the Treasury to step up bond supplies since 2023. On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office said the national debt could reach $50 trillion by 2034, equaling 122 percent of annual economic output. Early this year, COB warned that Unattended mounting debt concerns could lead to Liz-Truss-style market chaos, characterized by the sharp drop in the U.S. dollar and political uncertainty. Crypto pundits have long echoed a similar sentiment, saying debt concerns and loss of confidence in Treasuries could spur widespread adoption of alternative assets like bitcoin and gold.

And as a result of the project, participating members have now tripled, and are using us as a way to further their own digital ambitions.\u201d Like many other central banks, the SNB is not interested in retail CBDC experimentation, only the digital cash flow from institutions for wholesale securities settlement. Newns said other approaches were considered, such as a trigger mechanism in the real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) of the central bank every time a transaction takes place on a blockchain, or a bankruptcy-remote entity holding members' deposits in some kind of stablecoin. \u201cBut nothing really works like central bank money does, which is why it is the settlement asset that everyone prefers to use whenever possible,\u201d Newns said.

This means the exchange has now been cleared to operate in India, provided it pays the fine and complies with regulations. In its notice, FIU-IND said it imposed the fine \u201cdue to Binance\u2019s ongoing provision of services to Indian clients and operations within India, without adhering to its statutory obligations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\u201d The company was issued a notice under Section 13 of the PMLA on 28 December 2023.

On 10 May, Mint reported that Binance and fellow cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin were set to be cleared to operate in India after being suspended by FIU-IND in December. Vivek Aggarwal, director of FIU-IND, told Mint last month that the exchange was under scrutiny and had made representations to the unit, which is affiliated with the finance ministry. An email sent to Binance did not elicit an immediate response. No stranger to controversy Binance, which has no designated global headquarters, has courted controversy worldwide. In November 2023, its founder and erstwhile chief executive Changpeng Zhao pled guilty to money laundering charges by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. He subsequently stepped down as chief executive and agreed to a $4.3-billion settlement. Also read: Cryptocurrencies are rallying again, but concerns remain In November 2019, Binance had announced the acquisition of Indian crypto exchange WazirX. Zhao said at the time, \"The acquisition of WazirX shows our commitment and dedication to the Indian people and strengthen the blockchain ecosystem in India.\u201d But in August 2022, Zhao claimed his firm had never finalised a deal to acquire WazirX, days after the homegrown platform was accused of evading oversight by local agencies. More trouble for Indian crypto? Binance\u2019s potential return to the Indian market could mean more trouble for homegrown exchanges. India\u2019s cryptocurrency industry has been in the doldrums since 2022, when the union government introduced a 30% tax on crypto earnings and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every crypto trade. Since then daily average trades on India\u2019s largest exchanges, WazirX and CoinDCX, have cratered by up to 90%. A senior executive at one of India\u2019s top crypto firms, who did not wish to be named, said, \u201cGiven that Binance holds the world\u2019s largest liquid reserves of crypto tokens and the largest variety of token listings, many traders are likely to resume trading on the platform or move to it. This is likely to hurt homegrown exchanges\u2019 growth this year.\u201d Also read: What drives crypto HODLers despite volatility, uncertain regulations, high taxes Other stakeholders said that if Binance complies with the rules, India\u2019s crypto market will benefit from a major player's return.

He said, \u201cWhether cryptocurrencies are legitimate or not should depend on dedicated regulations, which are yet to be taken up by Parliament and policymakers.

Risk-on appetite is clearly building, and various tokens are at or near all-time highs. For those looking to create generational wealth, it\u2019s clear a handful of cryptos to buy have provided the kind of historical returns many are after. Focusing on just a few cryptos can be difficult, given the thousands out there. But in my mind, there are only a few top options for long-term investors to consider to build such wealth. Let\u2019s dive into three of the top three cryptos to buy. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Many experts believe Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) will continue to dominate the crypto space because of its distinctive qualities. The key focus for such experts is on Bitcoin\u2019s immutable nature, distinguishing it from other digital currencies that undergo frequent changes and updates by developers. Unlike these currencies, Bitcoin offers stability and certainty, making it a preferred choice among investors and users. No other crypto comes close to Bitcoin as a store of value. Long-term investors continue to hold this option through up and down markets, believing that this currency will hold up better than the dollar over time. And while the U.S. dollar has continued to show strength, Bitcoin\u2019s relative stability and status as a reserve asset could bode well for investors worried about future financial shocks. Trading near an all-time high (but still a ways to go), I think Bitcoin is worth a look for those concerned about choppiness ahead in the markets. Ethereum (ETH-USD) A perpetual runner-up to Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is also seeing strong adoption partly due to the SEC\u2019s recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. As was the case with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, these funds provide the validation investors have been looking for. And let\u2019s not forget the flood of capital into both assets many expect to see over time. Ethereum remains the top decentralized open-source network on which most applications are being built. This is a big deal for those bullish on the rise of decentralized finance. As traditional finance is experiencing a transformative shift, Ethereum is also adapting to these trends. Developers behind Ethereum are continuing to facilitate deeper integration into financial markets, shifting from a previous preference for private blockchains. Experience highlighted the transparency, accessibility and governance benefits of public blockchains like Ethereum. Ethereum transactions provide real-time visibility to all, ensuring transparent capital flow tracking and operational execution, which is crucial for building trust and broadening investor participation in blockchain financial products. Solana (SOL-USD) Solana ( SOL-USD ) has surged due to its solid technical base and proactive measures against issues like sandwich attacks. Trading volumes continue to remain robust, between $2 billion and $5 billion daily, showing sustained interest in this top layer-12 network. Notably, Solana also saw a significant increase in active wallets and new token accounts in June 2024, indicating continued network growth. Furthermore, recent news that Circle is expanding its Web3 services by integrating the Solana blockchain in two phases is boosting interest in the Solana network. The first phase introduces programmable wallets and gas stations for managing assets and sponsored transaction fees. Circle plans to enable NFT support and program interactions via the Smart Contract Platform in the second phase. This move integrates Solana alongside Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche in Circle\u2019s blockchain offerings. Programmable wallets on Solana automate interactions with smart contracts, handling tasks like transaction execution based on predefined conditions. Fuse Wallet, announced on June 10, also emphasizes programmability with smart accounts. It aims to address issues such as reliance on seed phrases and limited recovery options while offering customizable rules for on-chain interactions. For those bullish on Solana\u2019s low-cost and high-speed layer-1 network, now may be the time to start building a position.

SMEs represent more than 90 per cent of all businesses in China, according to the government, contributing more than 60 per cent of gross domestic product, more than 50 per cent of tax revenues, 80 per cent of employment and 70 per cent of innovation. China\u2019s SMEs have \u201cyet to display a strong trend of rebound\u201d despite showing slight improvement in business sentiment in March, according to the CKGSB Business Conditions Index, an independent survey by the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. China has a thriving SME environment, but it is facing challenges such as the complexity of cross-border trade, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters said in the same discussion. Getting access to trade finance is \u201ccomplex but vital\u201d for a prosperous SME ecosystem, he said. Standard Chartered is hoping digital technology and blockchain innovation can help support SMEs and facilitate cross-border transactions, connecting SMEs with the global supply chain. The bank has partnered with an unnamed Chinese tech company to develop a blockchain-enabled digital token to enhance the safety of supply-chain financing.

Here\u2019s How to Get In.Legendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget A.I. THIS Technology Is the Future\u201d", "content": "If you\u2019re bullish on crypto after Bitcoin\u2019s ( BTC-USD ) most recent resurgence in popularity, you might be wondering what the best cryptos to buy are. Specifically, what are the best cryptocurrency projects to buy into now in hopes that their adoption will be widespread enough in a decade to yield outstanding returns? Unlike investing in stocks, investing in crypto is far more ethereal and far less regulated. After all, the first American stock exchange started in 1792. Bitcoin became publicly available in 2009. Thus, the concept of buying into cryptocurrency still isn\u2019t clear to the vast majority of people. Does investing in Bitcoin mean you expect it to become the legal tender of the future? Or is it just a way to try and multiply your hard-earned cash? Either way, the best cryptos to buy and hold for a decade are the most legitimate ones. They\u2019re the ones that have already seen attempts at adoption and integration into various financial systems. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Starting with the aforementioned, Bitcoin, no crypto is currently more likely to survive into the future than BTC. The reason? It has been around the longest and essentially started the industry, it has the highest trading volume and market cap and is the most widely applied and accepted as tender globally. Some governments, like El Salvador\u2019s, have even experimented with making it a part of their currency structures. Beyond these factors, the coin\u2019s success has inspired an entire industry of Bitcoin mining companies, which set up computer farms constantly decrypting algorithms to further the coin\u2019s circulation. That being said, investing in Bitcoin is not like investing in stocks. It\u2019s not a matter of a company\u2019s future value so much as it is the adoption of a highly technical technology. Thus, timing the market with Bitcoin is unlikely to yield successful results. Instead, consider the money invested as a long-term gamble and try to buy when the price of Bitcoin is well below its all-time high \u2014 unlike right now. Ethereum (ETH-USD) If Bitcoin seems too expensive to be worth it, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is always a second, more moderately priced investment option to hold onto. That\u2019s the main reason it\u2019s dubbed the \u201cworld\u2019s largest altcoin,\u201d because its mission is to offer a more ecosystem-based alternative to Bitcoin. Thus, the best long-term investors in ETH are those confident in the prospects of blockchain technology. That is because ETH\u2019s biggest value proposition is not as an alternative to fiat currency but rather as an open-source blockchain. As such, developers seeking to advance blockchain technology earn ETH coins that can turn into dollars as their value increases. ETH is also a major contributor to the concept of decentralized finance, which intends to circumvent traditional banking and allow for large-scale transactions to take place person to person via a blockchain. So, if you\u2019re bullish on blockchains and decentralized finance, ETH could be among the best alternative cryptos to buy into and hold for the next decade. Binance (BNB-USD) A coin tied directly to the performance of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, Binance ( BNB-USD ) is a more complex play than the other two on this list. That\u2019s because buying and holding Binance for the next decade means being certain of its value as an intermediary currency and being confident in the longevity of the Binance exchange. As the Binance exchange increases in popularity, so could the theoretical use and trading frequency of BNB. This would, in turn, increase its value and ultimate buying power. For investors, that means either using BNB as a means of storing valuable cash or having an efficient way to trade for other cryptos on the Binance platform.

DOGE open interest, or the number of unsettled futures contracts, have decreased from nearly $800 million on Monday to $611 million as of Thursday, also indicating a drop in demand for the tokens. The rates briefly turned red over a few eight-hour trading sessions in March, but not for an extended period as seen this week so far.

The second campaign will disburse 2.5 million to participants who complete various tasks and quests on the platform. The airdrop will be disbursed in a points system, with participants earning corresponding points for each task and quest completed and ranked on a leaderboard. The second Fuse Network airdrop campaign aims to provide participants and users on the platform with greater incentives and opportunities to engage within the ecosystem. According to the , Fuse Network has also partnered with Layer 3, a blockchain-based platform designed to enhance user engagement and reward participation, to enhance the rewards available to participants. The season will run on a rolling basis, allowing for continuous participation and opportunities to earn. The airdrop will reset the leaderboard, from Season 1, giving new participants an opportunity to get rewards as well. Nonetheless, Season 1 participants who already earned points by bridging tokens, providing liquidity, and staking will continue to earn the same points in Season 2 automatically. Introducing New Enhanced Quests and Partners The latest airdrop campaign has added several partners to enhance rewards and increase participation. Some of the partners added include Meridian, LogX, Mirakle, Lynx Finance, GoodDollar, Demented Games, and more. In addition, new enhanced quests have been added, via the partnership with Layer 3, to increase engagement and discovery within the Fuse Network, enabling participants to reap maximum rewards. A number of quests from the first season will be available, with new quests added to the recently launched campaign and more set to be launched in the coming days. To start earning points, users can follow Fuse network on Twitter and Telegram, hold more than 2 different tokens on the Fuse network, invite friends, and bridge assets via the Fuse bridge. Additional quests from the first season include having a Fuse wallet older than 1 year, providing liquidity on Voltage, and staking $FUSE and tokens on Voltage. New enhanced quests include claiming GoodDapp\u2019s $G tokens, lending on Meridian and staking $FUSE via the Volt App. In the coming days, new quests and tasks will be added including joining the Fuse Discord, borrowing on Meridian, staking $QIJI on Mirakle DEX, depositing and staking $VOLT tokens via the Volt app, providing liquidity on LogX and Lynx and playing roulette on Demented Games. Season 1 Token Distribution Completed The first Fuse Network airdrop campaign was extended following issues involving referral points calculations and the presence of bad actors attempting to abuse the system. However, the team successfully reviewed and secured the airdrop distribution, ensuring only legitimate participants were rewarded. As of the time of writing, the team has updated the points in the Airdrop UI and recalculated the points for all participants correctly.

Sumer.money tackles these by enabling asset mobility across chains, aiming to standardize Web3 transactions like traditional finance.", "content": "Universal everyday payments seem so simple in traditional finance (TradFi). Simply swipe a card here, type a pin there, and voila! The payment is done. If the process is so simple, why is it seemingly so difficult to establish the same simplicity through Web3? Ultimately, the goal is to establish the same ubiquitous nature of debit cards in , but this has been difficult, if not quite impossible, until now. Despite the security and immutability of the blockchain, the move towards more user-friendly interactions with everyday payments poses substantial hurdles ahead. To actualize this goal and overcome the bottlenecks facing blockchain ecosystems today, a new standard must be set to ensure liquidity-free movement without compromising decentralization. However, first, Web3 must tackle the seemingly immovable obstacle to asset freedom and interconnection \u2014 composability. Composability Exposed When referring to composability of blockchain technology, it means the ability for different protocols and systems to cooperate and build harmoniously \u2014 without bottlenecks or limitations. As a fundamental part of , composability enables many applications to work syncroniously in an efficient and interconnected fashion. However, the problem arises when we observe the current state of blockchain composability, in which there is of distinct lack of connection. This disconnect leads to a fragmented system, separated and reliant on modern solutions to inefficiently bridge the gap between blockchains, , and more. Worse still is that each blockchain, bridge or dApp often creates its own custom solutions \u2014 further disconnecting the space and reducing any chance of composability between chains. A simple example would be wrapped cryptocurrency assets, which represent assets on another blockchain. These wrapped assets, like wrapped Ether (ETH) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is not actually ETH \u2014 just a representation of it. This divide in composability creates barriers to the movement of assets and liquidity access between blockchains, applications, and platforms which tells us one thing \u2014 a new standard is needed. A New Standard If there will ever be a day that Web3 assets can move a smoothly as finances through debit card everyday transactions, then a significant new universal standards must be created. Such a standard would need to enable value retention of assets without sacrificing functionality or requiring repeated reconfiguration to facilitate movement across different chain or dApp infrastructure. In a similar way to how the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) made it possible to establish universal communication across the internet \u2014 Web3 needs to find its own solution. By removing the complexities of cross-chain interactions and transactions for developers and users, Web3 will finally be able to move assets as easily and universally as debit cards. is an example of such a protocol driving innovation in this field, working to address these composability challenges. Working to become the asset abstraction layer for Web3 through its omni-chain synthetic assets and money market protocol, Sumer.money allows users to deposit assets on on-chain and create synthetic versions of USD, , and . These synthetic assets can then be traded across multiple supported chains. A TradFi example of how this works is similar to using a debit card where a user\u2019s funds are located in their local bank, then made globally accessible without need for clunky monetary transitions. Synthetic Solutions: Web3\u2019s Obi Wan Synthetic assets, like those created by Sumer.money, offer what could be the \u201conly hope\u201d for a solution to the Web3 composability problem. These synthetic assets can digitally represent real-world assets (RWAs) and other digital assets, without losing peg to their actual value. This enables protocols like Sumer.money to empower users with the ability to leverage their assets throughout the blockchain ecosystem \u2014 without hindrance or liquidity issues. Sumer.money\u2019s approach takes the best of synthetic solutions by depositing assets in a local space (the user\u2019s specified blockchain) and creating synthetic assets from them that can travel freely across all supported chains. This utility assures liquidity never becomes trapped within the confines of single chain and opens up access to liquidity without traditional Web3 barriers. Imagine depositing ETH on the Ethereum blockchain and using the created synthetic ETH on an entirely different chain to transact or \u2014 all the while, the original ETH is tucked securely in its native chain. With synthetic assets, this is possible. Further enhancing synthetic solutions, Sumer.money utilizes a risk engine to intelligently underwrite user assets with liabilities based upon correlations to maximize capital efficiency. In layman\u2019s terms, this means that every dollar locked in Sumer.money has the potential to unlock two dollars for partners and create further liquidity for a blockchain. This system improves liquidity and improves security in a more interconnected DeFi space. Establishing the Universal Standard The path ahead to creating an universal standard, similar to debit card everyday transactions, is a bumpy one fraught with hurdle after hurdles to overcome. Luckily for Web3, protocols like Sumer.money and the potential of synthetic solutions are working to turn what was once thought near-impossible into a reality. Innovators like Sumer.money are building a universal Web3 standard, maintaining focus on composability between different blockchains and establishing an interconnected system through asset abstraction. With time and steady adoption, these kinds of composability solutions will enable future users to interact with assets without barriers across multiple chains in a world not plagued by fragmentation. Through synthetic solutions, a universal standard can be achieved, reaching debit card level user-friendly in Web3 without having to climb through heaps of technical complexities. These solutions represent a positive step forward towards transitioning the versatility and connectedness of Web2 into the decentralized Web3 \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of time.", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 09:27:00", "image_url": "https://coincodex.com/en/resources/images/admin/news/can-synthetic-soluti/synthetic-solutions-web3.png:resizeboxcropjpg?1580x888.jpg", "source_id": "coincodex", "source_priority": 7905, "source_url": "https://coincodex.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons_crypto/coincodex.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "technology,adoption", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_stats": "positive:6.17,neutral:93.03,negative:0.8"}, {"article_id": "8010fc8c61ac6134b5e804caecf2bc9f", "title": "Solana-Ether Ratio Hits 3-Month Low, Analyst Anticipates Further Losses", "link": "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/20/solana-ether-ratio-hits-3-month-low-analyst-anticipates-further-losses/", "keywords": "markets,news,solana,ether,markets,technical analysis", "creator": "Omkar Godbole", "video_url": null, "description": "The ratio has declined 35% in one month, reaching the lowest since March 13.", "content": "A month ago, CoinDesk discussed how spot ether (ETH) ETF speculation could spur an outflow of money from altcoins, including Solana's SOL token and into ether. The market has since behaved as expected, with the ratio between SOL and ETH's dollar-denominated prices falling nearly 35% to 0.038 on Binance, the lowest since March 13, according to charting platform TradingView. The decline has put the bears in control and further losses could be seen, according to crypto trader and analyst Josh Olszewicz. \"SOL/ETH [is] rolling over,\" Olszewicz said on X , noting key bearish developments on the technical chart like the penetration of the Ichimoku cloud support. Japanese journalist Goichi Hosada created the Ichimoku Cloud in the late 1960s. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K) and a lagging closing price line. The difference between Leading Span A and B makes up the cloud, which is used to identify broader trends. Crossovers below the cloud, as in SOL/ETH's case, represent a bearish shift in the market trend. The SOL/ETH chart also shows a failure of a usually bullish pattern called the ascending triangle, identified by a rising support line and a horizontal resistance line. Ascending triangles develop when buyers are dominant and usually pave the way for extending the preceding uptrend. However, the SOL/ETH pair has dived below the ascending trendline support line, signaling a bearish trend change. Though the path of least resistance is to the downside, the pair may see temporary recovery rallies should there be outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, according to Olzewicz. Note that in the month following the debut of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF saw $6.5 billion in outflows, offsetting substantial inflows into the other funds.

It started off the year on a tear and hit a new all-time high of $73,000 in April. Yet since then, it has struggled to mount any momentum. It seems that any time it tries to make a run at a new high, it inevitably falters and ends up going two steps back. Kind of like what happened recently. After a notable push at the beginning of the month, the crypto has quickly erased all those gains. This raises the question: If Bitcoin keeps sputtering, is it really worth buying this dip? Understanding the recent dip Bitcoin can take a dip for various reasons, including regulatory news, changes in market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and flushing of built-up leverage. However, the recent dip appears to just be a situation where traders are simply taking profits after significant price increases, an easy situation to understand when considering Bitcoin climbed more than 65% in the first three months of 2024. From this perspective, it would be safe to say this pullback is nothing to be concerned about. Furthermore, dips like this are not unusual, even in bull markets. During the 2021 bull run, there were four pullbacks of more than 20%. For those who were around during the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin experienced seven corrections of more than 30%. Despite these significant pullbacks, Bitcoin still went on to set new all-time highs and generate triple-digit returns. These patterns demonstrate that volatility is a natural part of its growth trajectory, and that periods of decline can present valuable buying opportunities for long-term investors. Stepping back and seeing the bigger picture During times like this, it's crucial to take a step back and avoid getting caught up in the short-term panic. Clearly, Bitcoin has proved these corrections are nothing it can't overcome. But if for some reason this pullback is particularly concerning to you, it can be helpful to zoom out and not miss the forest for the trees, remembering what makes this crypto unique. Most noteworthy is Bitcoin's leading levels of decentralization and security. It is the most decentralized cryptocurrency with nearly 20,000 nodes scattered around the world. And it is the most secure, with a network that is 500 times more powerful than the world's most capable supercomputer. By distributing control across a global network of nodes and miners , Bitcoin minimizes the risk of manipulation and enhances its resilience against censorship. In a world that increasingly values privacy and autonomy, its decentralized model stands out as a robust and reliable alternative to traditional financial systems. Last but not least, keep in mind that Bitcoin has a finite supply. With only 21 million bitcoins that will enter circulation, this scarcity creates an ideal supply-and-demand dynamic -- not only for value preservation but also for appreciation. With increasing adoption and institutional interest, the cryptocurrency is positioned favorably to recover small losses like we've seen recently. It can also continue defying expectations as demand grows for its finite supply. Some final things to keep in mind When focusing on just the last few months, it's reasonable to think that this dip might spook some investors. But in the grand scheme of things, it should prove to be but a small speed bump on Bitcoin's near-inevitable path of price appreciation, just like every past one. With this in mind, the current dip is a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors. While Bitcoin's ups and downs will likely never completely disappear, its core strengths and the broader macroeconomic trends suggest a bright future. As always, it's important to do your research, understand your risk tolerance , and invest wisely. But for those with a long-term perspective, buying Bitcoin on the dip could be a rewarding decision.", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 08:27:09", "image_url": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F781049%2Funsure-investor-shrugging.jpg&op=resize&w=700", "source_id": "fool", "source_priority": 778, "source_url": "https://www.fool.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/fool.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "coin fundamental,adoption", "sentiment": "positive", "sentiment_stats": "positive:75.36,neutral:24.35,negative:0.29"}, {"article_id": "9cc78f02053c65a39235144db179fac8", "title": "Finance ministry imposes Rs 18.82 crore penalty on the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/finance-ministry-imposes-rs-18-82-crore-penalty-on-the-worlds-largest-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance/articleshow/111132777.cms", "keywords": null, "creator": null, "video_url": null, "description": "India's Financial Intelligence Unit fines Binance $2.25 million for violating anti-money laundering regulations, as reported by Reuters.", "content": "Binance has been fined $2.25 million (Rs 18.82 crore ) by India's Financial Intelligence Unit ( FIU ) for violating the country\u2019s anti-money laundering regulations, reports Reuters. \u201cAfter considering the written and oral submissions of Binance, the Director, FIU-IND, based on the material available on record, found that the charges against Binance were substantiated\u201d the financial watchdog said in a notification.

This year's price action of privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) is a perfect example. XMR crashed over 35% to $100 in early February after Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume and open interest, delisted the token, saying it didn't meet the exchange's standard. It has taken XMR four months to recoup the slide. The cryptocurrency briefly topped $180 last week, hitting the highest since January 23, and was last seen changing hands near $170 on Kraken, according to charting platform TradingView. XMR has gained nearly 25% in four weeks, outperforming most top 100 cryptocurrencies by market value, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) . While the exact reason for the price surge is not apparent, social media chatter suggests the recent crackdown on Botnet mining in some European countries may have helped. Botnet mining is a malicious practice of remotely using a compromised computer network to mine a cryptocurrency. Cybercriminals have long preferred XMR for botnet mining as its privacy features make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to track the flow of funds obtained through botnet mining and other illegal activities. The recent decision by 2Miners, one of the leading monero mining pools, to discontinue mining XMR may have also contributed to the rally. The miner announced the XMR delisting on June 10. It's worth noting that while XMR has reversed the February slide, it is yet to break out of the two-year trading range of $100-$185. Momentum studies do suggest the potential for a breakout ahead. For instance, the 50-day simple moving average of XMR's price has crossed above the 200-day SMA, confirming what is known as a golden cross. The pattern suggests a potential long-term bullish shift in momentum.

Issued by investment management firm VanEck, the new investment product is trading under the ticker symbol \u201cVBTC\u201d. It\u2019s not the first bitcoin ETF to launch in Australia, others have been available for some time on the smaller exchange Cboe Australia. But it is a first for the ASX, our largest stock exchange. If international experience is anything to go by, the ASX\u2019s new bitcoin spot ETF is likely to draw significant interest and could be the first of many similar products. In January, American investment manager BlackRock launched a similar product in the US \u2013 \u201cIBIT\u201d \u2013 which has since grown to manage almost A$30 billion in assets. As Australia braces for a possible flood of new mainstream cryptocurrency investment products, it is important to know more about how they work and what risks they might entail. Read more: What do I need to know before investing in ETFs and what are the risks? ETFs are investment products that track the performance of an underlying asset. Like shares, they can be traded on a public stock exchange. But buying an ETF is like buying a basket of different investments, the contents of which can vary. Bitcoin or gold ETFs, for example, track the price of just one commodity. But equity ETFs can track whole collections of stocks, combined in proportions that reflect a particular index. It is important to understand the difference between \u201cspot\u201d ETFs which actually hold their underlying investments, and \u201cfutures\u201d ETFs which invest in derivative securities to approximate the performance of their nominal investments. For example, BlackRock\u2019s IBIT product is a spot ETF, because it invests in bitcoin directly. A different ETF \u2013 ProShares \u201cBITO\u201d \u2013 is a futures ETF, because it invests in bitcoin futures (contracts to buy or sell bitcoin at a future date) in a way that tracks the price of the underlying asset. Bitcoin ETFs are gaining momentum because they allow traditional investors to access a popular asset class that is still largely unregulated. Unlike buying cryptocurrency directly, the transaction is mediated by a large ETF issuer and takes place through a regulated stock exchange. But they also create new costs, including management fees that can significantly impact returns. In the US, the watershed moment for spot bitcoin ETFs came on January 10 this year, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 of them. These funds have since accumulated more than A$75 billion in combined assets under management, and BlackRock\u2019s IBIT \u2013 the most liquid (easiest to buy and sell) \u2013 regularly sees more than A$1 billion in trades in a day. In comparison, existing Australian bitcoin ETFs are orders of magnitude smaller in scale. Global X\u2019s \u201cEBTC\u201d, which has traded on Cboe Australia since 2022, manages just over A$100 million in assets and sees a mere fraction of the trade volume. This means liquidity \u2013 the ease with which an asset can be bought, sold and converted to cash \u2013 is much higher in the US. The contrast between the US and Australia on this front is driven in large part by the different degree of involvement by institutional investors. Ease of trade means big asset management funds around the world are more likely to trade in the US, further fuelling total assets under management over there. This institutional involvement in bitcoin markets has become substantial. Some 12.5% of the currency\u2019s 21 million coin supply cap is now held by just 90 institutional entities , including countries, publicly traded companies and ETFs. For huge institutional investors trading millions or billions of dollars at a time, liquidity is typically the main cost consideration when trading ETFs. Low liquidity can make it harder to buy and sell at a favourable price. But for smaller retail investors it\u2019s management fees. A management fee of 1% per year means that if an investment grows from $100 to $105 over the course of the year, an investor will only end up with $104 in their account. $1 goes to the ETF issuer. It might not seem like a lot, but for a buy-and-hold investor, small differences in management fees can matter a lot. For example, over ten years, a hypothetical starting investment of $10,000 with a constant annual return of 5% would earn $1,178 less by investing in an ETF with a 1% management fee compared to one with a 0.2% management fee. Today\u2019s ASX listing has already ignited a management fees \u201c price war \u201d between VanEck and rival bitcoin ETF provider Global X. Global X will reduce their ETF\u2019s management fee to 0.59% from July, to match VanEck\u2019s new offering. But in the US, many bitcoin ETFs have lower fees, some in the range of 0.2%-0.25% . The Australian market for bitcoin ETFs is smaller and \u2013 for now \u2013 significantly less competitive than its US counterpart. Depending on the success of new launches like today\u2019s, market dynamics will reveal whether the Australian market will eventually see lower fees, more liquidity, and other ETF issuers joining the Australian offerings.

Jeremy Allaire , CEO of stablecoin issuer Circle, voiced increased optimism about the current state of cryptocurrencies and expected significant advancements over the next decade. What Happened: In a long post on X Wednesday, Allaire enthusiastically remarked, \"I'm more bullish than I have ever been about crypto.\" The technologist outlined how sentiment around cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin BTC/USD drastically changed in the last 10 years. Blockchain technologies, initially dismissed as fringe, illegal, and uninteresting, progressively evolved to give a layer of trust to the otherwise excessively centralized internet. Apart from the mainstreaming of blockchain infrastructure, Allaire noted how digital tokens have become more integrated into the global economy. \"Bitcoin itself has become one of the largest and most important alternative investment assets on the planet,\" the entrepreneur remarked.

Investors increased their bearish bets on prominent cryptocurrencies such as XRP and Cardano Wednesday, raising the prospect of gains in the event of liquidation. What Happened: According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, XRP and Cardano witnessed heavy shorting following a temporary bounce due to the SEC\u2019s decision to withdraw the security probe into Ethereum ETH/USD . That said, traders didn't find confidence in the relief rally, with most preferring to short the two altcoins.

If the market moves against these positions, it could lead to significant liquidations and short squeezes, i.e., short sellers closing their positions. Since short sellers exit their positions with buy orders, this event can push the price further up, effectively acting as \"the rocket fuel.\" Why It Matters: These observations come on the heels of a sharp surge in Open Interest, particularly for XRP , leading analysts to forecast a bullish pivot. In the last 24 hours, the OI in XRP futures rose 0.78%, according to Coinglass. Similarly, ADA's OI rose 0.16% over the last 4 hours. An increase in OI, coming alongside a dip in price, reflects the opening of new short positions.

The VanEck Bitcoin ETF launched with around A$990,000 ($660,429) in assets on the Australian Securities Exchange and is the culmination of over three years of negotiations with operator ASX. The fund will not own bitcoin directly, but invest in the U.S.-listed VanEck Bitcoin Trust, which launched in January. VanEck's European subsidiary also manages 12 similar cryptocurrency funds. Investors have poured billions of dollars into cryptocurrency ETFs in the U.S. after regulators approved several products in January. Hong Kong followed in April with the launch of six funds, although interest there has been more muted. VanEck Australia said in March the greenlight from U.S. regulators triggered a jump in requests from brokers and financial advisers for similar products. The price of bitcoin has almost tripled since 2023, although prices have stalled since a peak in March. A competitor exchange in Australia run by the local subsidiary of CBOE Global Markets already hosts several bitcoin ETFs.

Adoption is not yet widespread, but financial institutions with blockchain capabilities in place will have a strategic advantage.", "content": "the process of creating a unique digital representation of an asset on a blockchain network, has reached a tipping point after many years of promise and experimentation. The benefits\u2014including programmability, composability, and enhanced transparency\u2014can empower financial institutions to capture operational efficiencies, increase liquidity, and create new revenue opportunities through innovative use cases. These benefits are being realized today, with the first at-scale applications . However, there have been many false starts and challenges thus far. Further integration of these technologies into the mainstream in a robust, secure, and compliant manner will require cooperation and alignment among all involved stakeholders. As infrastructure players pivot away from proofs of concept to robust scaled solutions, many opportunities and challenges remain to reimagine how the future of financial services will work (see sidebar, \u201cWhat is tokenization?\u201d). is the process of issuing a unique digital representation of an asset on a blockchain, which is a type of distributed ledger. This digital representation is the \u201ctoken,\u201d which can be invested, exchanged, or pledged (for example, used as collateral). Tokens can represent a broad range of assets, including physical assets such as real estate or art; financial assets such as equities or bonds; intangible assets such as intellectual property; and even identity and unstructured data. Tokenization effectively creates a large universally available digital vault in which assets reside and never leave, but whose ownership can be transferred and tracked with total fidelity. Tokenizing assets on a blockchain has many benefits over existing disparate and siloed centralized ledgers. These include increased operational efficiency (for instance, reduced reconciliation needs and errors), composability (the ability to interact with other assets and applications on the network) and programmability (the ability to embed code in the token and its capacity to engage with smart contracts, enabling higher degrees of automation). Tokenizing creates new possibilities along the value chain for financial institutions engaging with the new financial market infrastructure (FMI), potentially unlocking cost savings, net new revenues, or opportunities to reduce risk across asset classes. One recent prominent example of tokenization is the increasing adoption of tokenized money market funds, which surpassed $1 billion in total value in Q1 2024. Immutable data on the shared ledger reduces data errors associated with manual reconciliation, while 24/7 instant settlement and composability provide better user experience and new revenue sources for FMIs. For example, tokenized money market funds could be used for payments, enhancing capital efficiency for holders. Such products are offered by incumbents BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton, as well as Web3 natives Ondo Finance, Superstate, and Maple Finance. If we were to design the future of financial services, we would arguably include many of the features of tokenized digital assets: 24/7 availability; instant global collateral mobility; equitable access; composability, thanks to a common technology stack; and managed transparency. Highlighting the strategic future of this technology, Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said in January 2024, \u201cWe believe the next step going forward will be the tokenization of financial assets, and that means every stock, every bond [...] will be on one general ledger.\u201d More and more institutions are rolling out and scaling tokenized products, from tokenized bonds and funds to private equity and cash. The digitization of assets seems even more inevitable now as the technology matures and demonstrates measurable economic benefits. Despite this visible momentum, broad adoption of tokenization is still far away. Modernizing existing infrastructure is challenging, especially in a regulation-heavy industry such as financial services. Overcoming inertia requires coordination across the value chain. Given this, we expect the adoption of tokenization to occur in multiple waves: the first will be driven by use cases with proven return on investment and existing scale. Next will be use cases of asset classes whose current markets are smaller, benefits less apparent, or require solutions to tougher technical challenges. Based on our analysis, we expect that total tokenized market capitalization could reach around $2 trillion by 2030 (excluding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins like Tether), driven by adoption in mutual funds, bonds and exchange-traded notes (ETN), loans and securitization, and alternative funds. In a bullish scenario, this value could double to around $4 trillion, but we are less optimistic than previously published estimates as we approach the middle of the decade. In this article, we provide our perspective of how the adoption of tokenization could play out. We describe the current state of adoption (focused mostly on a limited set of assets), as well as the benefits and feasibility of wider tokenization. We then examine current use cases that take aim at a meaningful market share and provide a rationale for waves of growth across different asset classes. For the remainder of the major financial asset classes, we examine the \u201ccold start\u201d problem and offer practical steps for how it may be overcome. Finally, we consider the risks and benefits for first movers, and consider the \u201ccall to action\u201d for all participants in the future of financial market infrastructure. Tokenization in waves Tokenization\u2019s rate and timing of adoption will vary across asset classes resulting from differences in expected benefits, feasibility, time to impact, and market participants\u2019 risk appetite. We expect those factors to characterize likely waves of activity and adoption. Asset classes that have larger market value, higher friction along the value chain today, less mature traditional infrastructure, or lower liquidity are more likely to achieve outsize benefit from tokenization. For instance, we believe tokenization feasibility is highest for asset classes with lower technical complexities and regulatory considerations. The appetite for investing in tokenization likely scales inversely to the richness of fees earned from today\u2019s less efficient processes, depending on whether the functions sit in-house or are outsourced, and how concentrated the main players and their fees are. Outsourced activities often reach economies of scale, reducing the incentives for disruption. Time to impact\u2014that is, how quickly returns on tokenized-related investments can be achieved\u2014can augment the business case and thus the appetite to pursue tokenization. A given asset class can lay the foundation for adoption of subsequent asset classes by ushering in greater regulatory clarity, infrastructure maturity, interoperability, and accelerated investment. Adoption will also differ by geography, influenced by a dynamic and shifting macroenvironment, including market conditions, regulatory frameworks, and buy-side demand. And finally, high-profile successes or failures could propel or restrict further adoption. Asset classes with the fastest paths to adoption Tokenization is progressing at a gradual pace, with acceleration expected as network effects gain momentum. Given their characteristics, certain asset classes will likely be faster to reach meaningful adoption\u2014defined as more than $100 billion of tokenized market capitalization\u2014by the end of the decade. We expect the most prominent front-runners will include cash and deposits, bonds and ETNs, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as loans and securitization. For many of these, adoption rates are already material, underpinned by greater efficiency and value gains from blockchain along with higher technical and regulatory feasibility. We estimate that the tokenized market capitalization across asset classes could reach about $2 trillion by 2030 (excluding cryptocurrencies and stablecoins), driven mainly by the above assets (Exhibit 1). The pessimistic and optimistic scenarios range from about $1 trillion to about $4 trillion, respectively. Our estimate is exclusive of stablecoins, including tokenized deposits, wholesale stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to avoid double counting, as these are often used as the corresponding cash legs in the settlement of trades involving tokenized assets. Mutual funds Tokenized money market funds have attracted over $1 billion in assets under management, signaling demand from investors with on-chain capital in a high-interest-rate environment. Investors can choose from funds managed by established incumbents, such as BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton, as well as Web3 natives such as Ondo Finance, Superstate, and Maple Finance. Tokenized money market funds will likely see sustained demand in a higher-interest-rate environment, potentially offsetting stablecoins as on-chain stores of value. Other types of mutual funds and ETFs could offer on-chain capital diversification to conventional financial instruments. The transition to on-chain funds can substantially increase utility, including instant 24/7 settlement and the ability to use tokenized funds as payment vehicles. As the scope and magnitude of tokenized funds grow, additional product-related and operations benefits will materialize. For instance, highly tailored investment strategies would become possible through composability across hundreds of tokenized assets. Having data on a shared ledger reduces errors associated with manual reconciliation, and increases transparency, leading to lower operational and technology costs. While the overall demand for tokenized money market funds partially depends on the interest rate environment, it now acts as the early green shoots of traction for other funds. Loans and securitization Blockchain-enabled lending is nascent, but disruptors are starting to see success in this space: Figure Technologies is one of the largest nonbank home equity line of credit (HELOC) lenders in the United States, with billions in origination volumes. Web3 natives such as Centrifuge and Maple Finance, together with Figure and others, have facilitated the issuance of over $10 billion of loans involving blockchains. We expect to see more adoption of tokenization for lending, especially with warehouse lending and securitizing on-chain loans. Conventional lending is characterized by labor-intensive processes and high levels of intermediary involvement. Blockchain-enabled lending provides an alternative, with many benefits: live, on-chain data, held in a unified master ledger serving as the single source of truth, fostering transparency and standardization throughout the lending life cycle. Smart-contract-enabled calculations of payouts and streamlined reporting reduce required cost and labor. Shortened settlement cycles and access to a broader capital pool enable faster transaction flow and potentially lower the cost of capital for borrowers. In the future, tokenizing a borrower\u2019s financial metadata or monitoring their on-chain cash flows could enable fully automated, fairer, and accurate underwriting. As more lending shifts to private credit channels, the incremental cost savings and speed represent attractive benefits for borrowers. Additional demand is expected from Web3 natives, as overall digital asset adoption grows. Bonds and exchange-traded notes Globally, over $10 billion worth of tokenized bonds in total notional value have been issued in the last decade (compared with $140 trillion outstanding notional globally). Noteworthy recent issuers include Siemens, the City of Lugano, and the World Bank, as well as other corporations, government-related entities, and international organizations. Additionally, blockchain-based repurchase agreements (repos) have found adoption, resulting in trillions of dollars of monthly transaction volume in North America and creating value from operational and capital efficiencies on existing flows. Digital bond issuance will likely continue given the high potential benefits once scaled, as well as comparably low barriers today, partially driven by an appetite to spur capital market development in certain regions. For example, in Thailand and the Philippines, the issuance of tokenized bonds enabled inclusion of small-ticket investors through fractionalization. While benefits so far have been demonstrated mostly for issuance, an end-to-end tokenized bond life cycle could unlock improved operational efficiencies of at least 40 percent through data clarity, automation, embedded compliance (for example, transferability rules encoded at a token level), and streamlined processes (for example, asset servicing). Additionally, lower costs, faster issuance, or fractionalization can improve financing for smaller issuers by enabling \u201cjust-in-time\u201d financing (that is, optimizing borrowing costs by raising specific amounts at specific times) and broadening the investor base by tapping into global pools of capital. Spotlight on repos Repurchase agreements, or \u201crepos,\u201d are one example where tokenization adoption and its benefits can be observed today. Broadridge Financial Solutions, Goldman Sachs, and J.P.Morgan currently transact trillions of dollars of repo volume per month. Unlike some tokenization use cases, repos do not require value-chain-wide tokenization to realize material benefits. Financial institutions that tokenize repos capture primarily operational and capital efficiencies. On the operational side, smart-contract-enabled execution automates daily life cycle management (for example, collateral valuation and margin top-ups). It reduces errors and settlement failures and simplifies reporting; 24/7 instant settlement and on-chain data also improve capital efficiency through intraday liquidity for short-term borrowing and enhanced collateral usage. Historically, most repo terms were 24 hours or longer. Intraday liquidity can decrease counterparty risks, reduce borrowing costs, enable lending of inert cash for short time increments, and reduce liquidity buffers. Real-time, 24/7, cross-jurisdictional collateral mobility could provide access to higher-yielding, high-quality liquid assets and enable optimized movement of this collateral across market participants, thus maximizing its availability. Subsequent waves of assets The first wave of assets described earlier has presented a somewhat independent pathway to adoption today and over the next two to three years. Conversely, tokenizing other asset classes will more likely scale only once the foundation has been laid by preceding asset classes or when a catalyst spurs advancement despite limited evidence for near-term benefits. One class of assets for which tokenization holds great potential, in the eyes of many market participants, is alternative funds, potentially sparking growth in assets under management and streamlining fund accounting. Smart contracts and interoperable networks can make managing discretionary portfolios at scale more efficient through automated portfolio rebalancing. They may also enable new sources of capital for private assets. Fractionalization and secondary market liquidity may help private funds access new capital from smaller retail and high-net-worth individuals. Additionally, transparent data and automation on a unified master ledger may create operational efficiencies for middle- and back-office activities. There are ongoing experiments from several incumbents, including Apollo and J.P.Morgan, testing what portfolio management on a blockchain could look like. To fully realize the benefits of tokenization, however, underlying assets must also be tokenized, and regulatory considerations may limit the obtainable upside. For several other asset classes, adoption will likely be slower, either because the expected benefits are only incremental or due to feasibility concerns such as satisfying compliance obligations or absence of incentives for adoption for critical market participants (Exhibit 2). These asset classes include publicly traded and unlisted equities, real estate, and precious metals. Overcoming the cold start problem A cold start problem is a common challenge to adopting innovation, in which products and their users need to grow at a healthy pace but neither succeeds alone. In the world of tokenized financial assets, issuance is relatively easy and reproducible, yet true scale can be achieved only when network effects are achieved: when users (typically, investors on the demand side) capture real value, whether from cost savings, higher liquidity, or enhanced compliance. In practice, while there has been traction in proof-of-concept experiments and single-fund launches, token issuers and investors still bump up against a familiar cold start problem: limited liquidity deters issuance due to inadequate transaction volume to establish a robust market; a fear of losing market share may cause first movers to incur additional expense by supporting parallel issuance on legacy technology; and despite considerable benefits, incumbents may experience inertia due to the disruption of established processes (and associated fees). One such example is the tokenization of bonds. Barely a week goes by without the announcement of a new tokenized bond issuance. While there are billions of dollars of tokenized bonds outstanding today, benefits over traditional issuance are marginal, and secondary trading remains scarce. Here, overcoming the cold start problem would require constructing a use case in which the digital representation of collateral delivers material benefits\u2014including much greater mobility, faster settlement, and more liquidity. Delivering true, sustained long-term value requires coordination across a multifaceted value chain and widespread engagement of participants with the new digital asset class. Given the complexity of upgrading the underlying operating platform for the financial services industry, we posit that a minimum viable value chain (MVVC) (by asset class) is required to enable the scaling of tokenized solutions and overcome some of its challenges. To fully realize the benefits laid out in this article, financial and partner institutions must cooperate on common or interoperable blockchain networks. This interconnected infrastructure represents a new paradigm and has triggered regulatory concerns and some feasibility challenges (Exhibit 3). There are several ongoing efforts to build common or interoperable blockchains for institutional financial services, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s Project Guardian and the Regulated Settlement Network. In Q1 2024, the Canton Network pilot brought together 15 asset managers, 13 banks, plus multiple custodians, exchanges, and a financial infrastructure provider to perform simulated transactions. This pilot validated that traditionally siloed financial systems can successfully connect and synchronize, utilizing a public-permissioned blockchain while maintaining privacy controls. While there are successful examples on public and private blockchains, it is unclear which will host the most transaction volume. Currently, in the United States, most federally regulated institutions are discouraged from using public blockchains for tokenization. But globally, many institutions are choosing Ethereum, a public network, for the liquidity and composability it enables. As unified ledgers continue to be built and tested, the public versus private network debate is far from over. A path forward Comparing the current state of tokenization of financial assets with the emergence of other paradigm-shifting technologies suggests we are in early stages of adoption. Consumer technologies (such as the internet, smartphones, and social media) and financial innovations (such as credit cards and ETFs) typically exhibit their fastest growth (over 100 percent annually) in the first five years after inception. Thereafter, we find annual growth slows to around 50 percent, and ultimately a more modest compound annual growth rate of 10 percent to 15 percent is achieved after ten-plus years. Significant issuance of tokenized assets was not seen until the last few years, even though trials began as early as 2017. Our market capitalization estimates for 2030 assume, on average, a compound annual growth of 75 percent across asset classes, with Wave 1 assets leading the way. Although it is fair to expect tokenization to spur such a multidecadal transformation of the financial industry, there may be particular benefits for early movers who are able to \u201ccatch the wave.\u201d Pioneers can capture oversized market share (especially in markets benefiting from economies of scale), enhance their own efficiency, and set the agenda for formats and standards, as well as benefit from the reputational halo of embracing emerging innovation. Early movers in tokenized cash payments and on-chain repos have demonstrated this. But many more institutions are in \u201cwait and see\u201d mode, anticipating clearer market signals. Our thesis that the case for tokenization is at a tipping point suggests that this mode may be too slow once we see some important signposts, including the following: While we have yet to see all these markers emerge, we anticipate waves of adoption (with widespread use) to follow the waves of tokenization described earlier. Such adoption will be led by financial institutions and market infrastructure players that assemble to establish leading positions in the capture of value. We call these collaborations minimum viable value chains. Examples of MVVCs are the blockchain-based repo ecosystems operated by Broadridge, and J.P.Morgan\u2019s Onyx with Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon. Over the next few years, we anticipate many more MVVCs emerging to capture value from additional use cases, such as instant business-to-business payments via tokenized cash; dynamic \u201csmart\u201d management of on-chain funds by asset managers; or efficient life cycle management of government and corporate bonds. These MVVCs will likely be supported by network platforms created by incumbents and fintech disruptors. There are risks as well as rewards for early movers: the up-front investment and risks of investing in new technology can be substantial. Not only is there a spotlight on first movers but developing infrastructure coupled with running a parallel process on a legacy platform is time and resource intensive. In addition, in many jurisdictions the regulatory and legal certainty to engage with any form of digital assets is lacking, and critical enablers, such as widespread availability of wholesale tokenized cash and deposits for settlement, have yet to be supplied. The history of blockchain applications is littered with casualties of such challenges. That history may deter incumbents who may feel more secure following business as usual on legacy platforms. But such a strategy creates risk, including material loss of market share. As today\u2019s high-interest environment has produced clear use cases for some tokenized products such as repos, market conditions have the potential to quickly sway demand. As signposts for the adoption of tokenization emerge, such as regulatory clarity or maturing infrastructure, trillions of dollars of value can move on-chain, creating a sizeable value pool for first movers and disruptors (Exhibit 4). In the near term, institutions, including banks, asset managers, and market infrastructure players, should assess their product suites and identify which assets would most benefit from transitioning to tokenized products. We suggest questioning whether tokenization can accelerate strategic priorities, such as entering new markets, launching new products, and/or attracting new customers. Are there potential use cases that can create value in the near term? And what internal capabilities or partnerships are required to capitalize on the opportunities created by this shift in the market? By aligning pain points (on the buy- and sell-sides) with buyers and market conditions, stakeholders can assess where tokenization creates the greatest risk to their market shares. But realizing the full benefits will require assembling counterparties to collaborate in creating a minimal viable value chain. Working through such growing pains now can help incumbent players avoid playing catch-up when demand inevitably surges. is a partner in McKinsey\u2019s London office; is a partner in the Bay Area office; is a partner in the Boston office; and is a consultant in the New York office, where is an associate partner.", "pubDate": "2024-06-20 00:00:00", "image_url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/from%20ripples%20to%20waves%20the%20transformational%20power%20of%20tokenizing%20assets/assettokenizationwaves-getty-685013067-thumb-1536x1536.png", "source_id": "mckinsey", "source_priority": 3186, "source_url": "https://www.mckinsey.com", "source_icon": "https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/mckinsey.png", "language": "english", "ai_tag": "adoption,blockchain", "sentiment": "neutral", "sentiment_stats": "positive:15.09,neutral:84.5,negative:0.41"}, {"article_id": "0bee3156533ed04f21ffc2b03985cfcf", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Rises More Than 3% In 24 hours", "link": "https://www.benzinga.com/insights/cryptocurrency/24/06/39401839/bitcoin-cash-rises-more-than-3-in-24-hours", "keywords": "cryptocurrency,benzinga,$bch,trading ideas,markets,movers,bzi-cml", "creator": "Benzinga Insights", "video_url": null, "description": "Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash's (CRYPTO: BCH) price has risen 3.54% to $389.63.

Martin \u201cPharma Bro\u201d Shkreli said on Tuesday that he was behind the controversial DJT token in an X space tuned in by thousands of people, days after denying any involvement, as colorfully reported by CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa . The flavor-of-the-week token caused certain crypto enthusiasts to extensively wonder who was behind it after it went viral on Monday for its supposed links to Donald Trump and his son Barron. Blockchain sleuths found that DJT\u2019s Telegram channel appeared to share the same admins as a token supported by Shkreli. Shkreli denied any involvement at the time, while DJT continued to rally. On-chain intelligence firm Arkham posted a $150,000 bounty that would pay out the amount to whoever unveiled the creator of the DJT token. This drew out ZachXBT, one of the most widely followed crypto sleuths on X, to submit his findings to Arkham. According to ZachXBT, that's when Shkreli \"panic\" DM'd him. The DJT token was down 58% in the past 24 hours \u2013 apparently due to some panic selling . As of press time there was a donnybrook raging on X over whether Shkreli now owes $100 million on a bet on whether the token was connected in some way to Trump. GRAY HAT? The crypto exchange Kraken said Wednesday in a tweet thread and blog post that it has contacted law enforcement after \"security researchers\" allegedly exploited a bug to withdraw nearly $3 million from artificially inflated account balances, and then refused to return the sums in accordance with the company's Bug Bounty program. \"This is not white-hat hacking, it is extortion!\" Kraken Chief Security Officer Nick Percoco wrote on X . IN THE CLEAR: The price of ether (ETH) rose after Consensys disclosed receiving letters from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notifying that the regulator had ended its investigation into the technology incubator company and was not going to recommend an enforcement action against it. The SEC told Consensys, whose products include the MetaMask wallet, it was not bringing any enforcement actions in a pair of letters sent to its law firms on Tuesday. In a blog post , Consensys said the SEC was \"closing its investigation into Ethereum 2.0.\" TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE.

Coinbase, the big crypto exchange, launched support for \" pre-launch markets \" on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced \u2013 for users in eligible jurisdictions of the U.S., UK and Canada. \"Once the underlying token is launched on relevant spot exchanges, these contracts seamlessly transition into standard perpetual futures contracts,\" according to a blog post . On Tuesday, Coinbase International Exchange tweeted that the pre-launch market was \"now in full trading mode\" for contracts on EigenLayer's new EIGEN token, which has been airdropped but not unlocked for trading . According to at least one estimate posted on X, the trading implies a fully diluted market capitalization for the EIGEN token at $12.2 billion.

Barnsley South candidate David White spoke at a Thai conference for the scheme - Buddy Ex - gesturing to the flashy backdrop and asking a sparsely attended conference for top salesmen: \u201cDoes this look like a scam?\u201d An investigation by Hope not Hate links Mr White to the cryptocurrency scheme Buddy Ex, which has listed him as a co-founder alongside Dubai-based entrepreneur Mahesh Sharma. So-called \"Multi-Level Marketing\" [MLM] companies are ostensibly set up to sell products or services directly to customers, employing agents sell to their friends and family. But many are structured so agents earn more from recruiting more salespeople - who usually have to pay signup fees and a share of any future profits to those who recruited them - than they do by marketing the product or service itself. Such schemes inevitably collapse when the number of new recruits dries up. The investigative website BehindMLM described Buddy Ex as a \u201cpump and dump Dubai ponzi scheme\u201d A spokesperson for Reform UK insisted Mr White had merely been a \u201cthird party supplier\u201d to the firm, \u201csupplying presentation videos and live events.\u201d But when Mr White delivered a speech at a Buddy Ex conference last August, he described himself to the whooping crowd as the firm\u2019s \u201cHead of Business in the UK and EU.\u201d Asked why he had done so if he was just a supplier, the spokesperson said: \u201cThat would be manners.\u201d They added: \u201cThey paid for him to go present in Thailand. It was a day travelling, a day of work and a day back. He had zero involvement in management, decision making or any financials.\u201d Later in the speech, delivered in front of a flashy backdrop to a room of cheering people in Buddy Ex t-shirts, he explained that as a politician, he had to keep his financial dealings above board. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out talking to your communities, your friends and families, what do people think of Buddy Ex? And one big thing that keeps coming back is: they think it\u2019s a fantastic project, but is it a scam?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a local councillor, and the political party that I represent has put me forward to stand as a member of parliament in the general election next year. So it\u2019s incredibly important to myself that everything is as clean as possible.

Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant by market cap despite a growing number of innovative new projects, and many investment products provide only a handful of concentrated positions. At Outerlands Capital we have written about the benefit to risk-adjusted returns from diversification. Individually, smaller projects may carry higher risk, but investing across a broad mix of projects can reduce volatility and improve risk-return metrics like the Sharpe ratio (returns normalized for volatility). However, there\u2019s more to diversification than higher Sharpe ratios. You're reading Crypto Long & Short , our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. In a market as dynamic as crypto, diversification is essential to gain exposure to the varied and evolving mix of themes and sectors built around blockchain technology. Diversification is about solving for the power law distribution of returns, whereby a portfolio\u2019s return is driven by a small number of highly positive outcomes against a larger number of investments that deliver lower, or negative, returns. This phenomenon is well documented in venture capital (VC) investing, and the concept carries over to digital asset investments, which are akin to investments in disruptive tech startups. Diversifying makes sure your portfolio has enough shots-on-goal to capture the biggest winners over time. A concentrated portfolio of just a handful of tokens will struggle to capture the range of exciting crypto use-cases being developed today. Take, for example, the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization \u2013 a popular take on a ready-made \u201cdiversified\u201d portfolio. You have here, essentially, a mix of currencies and Layer 1s. While these larger tokens are sometimes seen as less risky on account of scale, such a selection fails to capture much of the current innovation happening in crypto. Expand to an actively managed portfolio encompassing tokens from the Top 150 by market cap and you start to see a much more dynamic picture, spanning Layer 1s and related infrastructure (like scaling solutions and interoperability), DeFi (from trading and lending to asset management), entertainment (including gaming and the metaverse), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN, including projects for distributed compute power with tie-ins to AI), real-world-assets (RWAs), and more. While some of these projects may carry greater risk on their own, diversification helps manage the risk of the overall portfolio. Portfolios should be positioned to capture emerging themes and new directions as projects across the space continue to innovate, searching for product-market-fit. Even in the more developed parts of the crypto ecosystem, such as payments or Layer 1s, we believe it is still much too early to call winners. The pace of innovation means disruption will continue to be the norm. The nascency of the market and its fast-paced evolution also mean that an active approach to portfolio management is imperative: Diversified is not equal to passive. Building a well diversified portfolio does not mean just buying more, smaller assets. It means taking a long-term perspective on the scale and scope of the digital assets ecosystem, and positioning a portfolio to take advantage of the many different potential outcomes. Coming out of crypto conferences like Consensus, AIMA Digital Assets, Token2049, and DAS, we are again emboldened in our assessment that the average institutional crypto portfolio is simply not exposed to enough of the disruptive use-cases being tested in digital assets today. Budding themes such as DePIN, innovative scaling solutions for Ethereum and also Bitcoin, and bringing real-world-assets on-chain all require a deep look past the largest tokens, and should encourage portfolios of digital assets spanning many sectors and project sizes. Remember that diversifying doesn\u2019t make a portfolio less potent - it actually gives investors more opportunities to capture winners, while still providing time-tested risk benefits. In essence, diversification gives you more for less. Disclosure: The information herein is for general information purposes only and is not investment advice.

Let\u2019s take a look at SHIB\u2019s prospects for the future.", "content": "The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency made a massive splash in 2021 when the once obscure coin displayed one of the most explosive rallies in the history of the cryptocurrency markets. The coin, which had largely been ignored since its launch in the summer of 2020, suddenly began rising in the spring of 2021 and peaked at a massive market capitalization of $40 billion in October 2021. Following the peak in October 2021, the Shiba Inu price has mostly been heading downwards. While SHIB still retains an impressive market capitalization of $4.04 billion at the time of writing, the token is down about 79.4% from its all-time high. Naturally, this has left many SHIB holders asking themselves: \u201cWill Shiba Inu go up?\u201d SHIB is dismissed by some crypto market participants due to its meme token branding. However, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Shiba Inu\u2019s drop from its all-time high prices is comparable to the drops seen by many well-respected crypto projects. For example, both Uniswap\u2019s UNI and NEAR Protocol\u2019s NEAR have seen an almost identical decline from their all-time highs. We\u2019ll be taking a look at Shiba Inu\u2019s future prospects to see if SHIB will go up in the coming months and years. Before we explore whether Shiba Inu can return to its former glory, however, let\u2019s quickly refresh our memories about this popular crypto project. What is Shiba Inu? is a cryptocurrency that is issued as a token on the blockchain. It utilizes the ERC-20 standard, which is a common way for issuing fungible tokens on Ethereum. Shiba Inu was launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer using the pseudonym \u201cRyoshi\u201d. Another important figure in the Shiba Inu story is , who serves as the project\u2019s lead developer. One of the defining features of Shiba Inu is its massive token supply. The initial supply of SHIB was a whopping one quadrillion coins, although a large portion of the supply was gifted to Ethereum\u2019s inventor, (who is not affiliated with the project). Buterin later sold some of the SHIB he received to fund charitable donations and burned the rest of his SHIB tokens. When launched, Shiba Inu was presented as \u201cthe Dogecoin killer.\u201d Essentially, it was conceived as a meme token that would incorporate features made possible by Ethereum, such as decentralized finance. The project didn\u2019t catch on immediately but was found by crypto speculators once resulted in a speculative frenzy for DOGE. Speculators began buying up SHIB in the hopes of catching \u201cthe next Dogecoin\u201d, and many of them were successful in doing so. Will Shiba Inu go up? At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001808 and has a market capitalization of $10.6 billion, making it the 12th largest crypto asset by market cap. Making a Shiba Inu coin price prediction for 2024 is made difficult by the fact that SHIB has only been around for a short period of time. The SHIB coin was launched in August 2020 and wasn\u2019t really a relevant player in the crypto market until early 2021. This means that there\u2019s simply not a lot of historical data that would give us an idea of how the SHIB markets tend to perform over a longer time period. For example, if we take a look at an older cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, patterns such as 4-year halving cycles give us a better idea of how the BTC markets could perform. Reasons why Shiba Inu could go up One of the toughest tasks for any cryptocurrency project is simply getting its name out there and reaching a large number of people in the cryptocurrency community. Shiba Inu has already succeeded on this front, as it\u2019s one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and is listed on virtually all of the major cryptocurrency exchanges. Whether you\u2019re using , KuCoin, Kraken, OKX, or Coinbase, you can trade SHIB at any time. SHIB is a highly popular token - it\u2019s held by more than 1.3 million addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. There\u2019s also many users that hold all of their SHIB token holdings on cryptocurrency exchanges, so the real number of SHIB holders is even larger than 1.3 million. One of the biggest reason for SHIB\u2019s popularity is its low price per unit, which makes it appear cheap. The average person can quite easily buy hundreds of millions of SHIB tokens, which has made the token attractive to some. In reality, of course, users should be evaluating a token\u2019s market cap and not its price, but the fact remains that the psychological \u201ccheap coin\u201d effect can sometimes be very real. The downside of Shiba Inu\u2019s popularity is that there might not be as much room for growth left as some SHIB holders might be hoping. While Shiba Inu can rightfully be described as a meme token, it does have a team of developers who are trying to give the token improved utility. Perhaps the most notable project from the Shiba Inu team is , a layer 2 scaling solution that utilizes BONE, a token related to SHIB. According to developers, the Shibarium blockchain platform is focused on offering cheap and fast blockchain transactions for decentralized applications, especially in the gaming and metaverse sectors. Each transaction on the Shibarium platform , which contributes to reducing the supply over time, potentially contributing to making each SHIB token much more valuable over time. So far, Shibarium hasn't really had any impact on SHIB price through deflationary mechanics, but that could change significantly if and when it becomes more widely used. The Shiba Inu ecosystem also includes the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, as well as the Shiboshis NFT collection. There are also plans for a Shiba Inu-themed metaverse that would provide play-to-earn opportunities. If the Shiba Inu team impresses with its projects like Shibarium and the cryptocurrency market also turns more bullish overall, that could create a perfect storm to result in another bull run for SHIB. Reasons why Shiba Inu might not go up To put it simply, the Shiba Inu project hasn\u2019t yet delivered anything innovative from a technological perspective. The team\u2019s projects mostly focus on crypto trends that are already well underway - ShibaSwap came well after the stunning success of Uniswap, and the Shiboshis NFTs arrived relatively late during the 2021 NFT craze. In addition, while the Shiba Inu team has successfully launched the Shibarium layer 2 platform for Ethereum, it remains to be seen if Shibarium becomes widely used among Shiba Inu users. After all, the layer 2 space is already quite crowded with powerful platforms like Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and many others. One of the main reasons for Shiba Inu\u2019s meteoric ascent was that crypto speculators were looking for the \u201cnext Dogecoin\u201d after DOGE saw an incredible price surge in the spring of 2021, and Shiba Inu emerged as a viable candidate. It remains to be seen whether Shiba Inu\u2019s appeal as a meme coin has staying power or if other meme coins will come to surpass it in the future. When considering some of the popular price targets for SHIB, holders should probably temper their expectations. For example, we often see discussions on social media platforms about whether it\u2019s possible for . To put it simply, it\u2019s extremely unlikely and probably close to impossible for SHIB to reach such a price. It\u2019s also . Considering the current supply of SHIB tokens, a price of $0.01 would imply a market capitalization of 5.89 trillion for SHIB. To put this number in context \u2013 the highest the total cryptocurrency market cap has ever been is $3 trillion. Of course, this does not mean that SHIB can\u2019t reach or even exceed its all-time high price of $0.0000881. Shiba Inu coin prediction for 2023-2025 According to our as of June 2024, SHIB could see its price decline further in 2024. Currently, the price prediction by CoinCodex is estimating that SHIB will increase to roughly $0.0000400 in one year, which would represent a price increase of more than +122% compared to its current price. The algorithm also forecasts that SHIB will hit a peak of $0.0000805 in early 2024, which would be a 347% increase compared to the current price. After this peak, the algorithm expects SHIB to enter a prolonged price correction period which would see SHIB's price fall all the way back towards the $0.0000200 price level. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu market is in a bearish state overall, with the majority of the technical indicators tracked by CoinCodex displaying bearish signals. For a closer look at longer-term prediction models, we suggest you check our analysis of . The bottom line: It will likely take a crypto bull run for Shiba Inu to go up again The Shiba Inu coin\u2019s future will likely depend on how Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market perform in the future. The SHIB markets are still primarily driven by speculative demand, and SHIB will likely require an environment where crypto investors are comfortable with taking big risks before it can grow significantly. Of course, there is also a possibility that the Shiba Inu project excels with the delivery of the Shibarium layer 2 platform for Ethereum. If the platform sees a lot of activity, there could be a significant amount of SHIB tokens burned, which would make the token a more attractive asset to hold. The upside of Shiba Inu is limited by the fact that it already has a significant market capitalization and is already widely available to crypto investors \u2013 in other words, anyone who is interested in owning SHIB has already had the opportunity to do so. The coin has already hit major milestones, such as being listed on Binance and Coinbase, so it might be difficult for SHIB to find catalysts for major price rallies in the future. Despite this fact, Shiba Inu is still one of the to buy, primarily thanks to its growing ecosystem. So, will Shiba Inu go back up? It\u2019s certainly possible, but it will take the proper crypto market conditions for it to happen.

Several trends are shaping the altcoin market in 2024 that signify a focus on innovation, sustainability, and exploration of new use cases, driving growth among altcoins. Re-staking has emerged as a notable vertical for this new cycle, which involves continuously staking the rewards earned from staking tokens, compounding the returns over time. Projects like EigenLayer (EIGEN), EtherFi (ETHFI), and Renzo (REZ) have implemented mechanisms that encourage users to restake their staking rewards, thereby increasing their stake in the network and contributing to its security and stability. Altcoins are increasingly adopting Layer2 scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups, zkRollups and side-chains to improve transaction speeds and reduce fees. Projects in this category include Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Polygon (MATIC), Starknet (STRK), among many others. This trend aims to enhance user experience and attract more users to these projects\u2019 platforms. Interoperability between blockchain networks is also a growing trend. Some projects are collaborating and building bridges to enable asset transfers and communication across disparate blockchains. This trend aims to create a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem instead of many different siloed blockchains. Examples of such projects include Axelar (AXL), Across (ACX) and Stargate (STG). With the rise of Layer 2 solutions and interoperability, modular blockchains represent the next phase of digital assets\u2019 evolution. With their adaptable and customizable design, these offer a flexible framework where developers can plug-and-play modules like consensus mechanisms, token standards and governance models. Blockchains such as Celestia (TIA) and Dymension (DYM) are using this modularity to enhance scalability, interoperability and security. Parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs) break down smart contract execution into parallel tasks, harnessing the power of multiple nodes simultaneously. The most popular parallelized EVMs, such as Sei (SEI), Canto (CANTO), Nomad, and NeonEVM (NEON), are attempting to do this by processing transactions off-chain, then aggregating them back onto the Ethereum mainnet. This approach drastically improves transaction throughput and reduces latency, addressing Ethereum's historic limitations. Current crypto market prices seem to indicate that a bull market is underway, mega caps may still have room to grow before smaller coins outperform the rest of the market. However, this phase may not be far off and, once it begins, being under-positioned could be difficult and potentially costly, especially as institutional adoption grows and the need to generate alpha increases.

The total of $15 million from Jump, a Chicago-based investment firm, means almost $169 million so far has been amassed by Fairshake and its affiliated PACs as of Wednesday, according to spokesman Josh Vlasto, giving the young industry one of the most potent campaign-finance operations in the 2024 elections. The so-called super PACs have been flooding primaries with large-scale ad spending and seeing many of its favored candidates cruising toward what will be likely general-election wins in November. \"The crypto and blockchain communities have truly come together to form a sustainable bipartisan coalition and an effective operation that is built for the long term,\" Vlasto said in a statement. \"We will continue to support candidates who are committed to getting things done and working with the industry to pass responsible regulation that drives innovation, creates jobs, and sustains America\u2019s global leadership.\" A spokeswoman for Jump declined to comment on the donation. The company's eight-digit addition follows a recent series of matching $25-million follow-up donations from big crypto firms Coinbase Inc. (COIN), Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Fairshake and its brethren (two PACs called Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress) were still holding onto $109 million as of the May 31 filing with the Federal Election Commission, Vlasto said, with less than five months to go before the final voting. The spokesman confirmed the PAC has no plans to support presidential candidates, so the aim is to find proven congressional incumbents and crypto-friendly candidates. The sitting members of Congress are suddenly more easy to evaluate on that score. Previously, there weren't a lot of practical measures of crypto support to help grade politicians in the House of Representatives and Senate, but both chambers have now been through votes on digital assets efforts. In May, the House passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) that's the first wide-reaching crypto oversight legislation to clear either of the chambers of Congress. Its chances in the Senate are limited \u2013 depending on whether key lawmakers can somehow package it with a must-pass bill. But a side bonus for the industry was that it immediately learned which of the 435 members of the House are pulling for crypto regulations. Also in May, both chambers voted to reverse a contentious Securities and Exchange Commission crypto account policy, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121). The effort was smacked down by a veto from President Joe Biden, but it revealed 11 Democrats in the Senate were willing to join Republicans in bucking the SEC policy and the White House's preference. Both efforts saw a higher-than-expected showing of support from Democrats, and the tallies are being used to assess lawmakers. Stand With Crypto, an advocacy group started by Coinbase, maintains a grading system for politicians. The \"D\" grade for Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), for instance, reflects his no vote on the SAB 121 resolution, while the \"B\" grade for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) shows he was for it. \"Recent votes have helped us educate our advocates on where politicians stand on crypto,\" said Sabrina Siddiqui, a spokesman for the group, in a statement. She said Stand With Crypto reached more than a million online members several months earlier than anticipated because \"people were coalescing behind these key votes.\" The organization just added to its slate of endorsements this week, all 22 of them sporting \"A\" grades.

Nick Percoco, Kraken's chief security officer, said in a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that the firm received a \"bug bounty program\" alert from a security researcher on June 9 about a vulnerability that allows users to artificially inflate their balance. The bug \"allowed a malicious attacker, under the right circumstances, to initiate a deposit onto our platform and receive funds in their account without fully completing the deposit,\" Percoco added. Upon receiving the report, Kraken fixed the issue swiftly and no user funds were affected, Percoco noted. What came after raised red flags for Kraken's team. The security researcher, upon finding the bug, allegedly disclosed it to two other individuals, who then \"fraudulently\" withdrew nearly $3 million from their Kraken accounts. \"This was from Kraken\u2019s treasuries, not other client assets,\" Percoco said. The initial bug report didn't mention the two other individuals' transactions, and when Kraken asked for more details of their activities, they refused. \"Instead, they demanded a call with their business development team (i.e. their sales reps) and have not agreed to return any funds until we provide a speculated $ amount that this bug could have caused if they had not disclosed it. This is not white-hat hacking, it is extortion!\" Percoco wrote. Bug bounty programs \u2013 used by many firms to strengthen their security systems \u2013 invite third-party hackers, known as \"white hats,\" to find vulnerabilities so the company can fix them before a malicious actor exploits them. Kraken's competitor, Coinbase, has a similar program to help alert the exchange of vulnerabilities. To be paid the bounty, Kraken's program requires a third party to find the problem, exploit the minimum amount needed to prove the bug, return the assets and provide details of the vulnerability, Kraken said in a blog post , adding that since the security researchers didn't follow these rules, they won't get the bounty. \"We engaged these researchers in good faith and, in-line with a decade of running a bug bounty program, had offered a sizable bounty for their efforts. We\u2019re disappointed by this experience and are now working with law enforcement agencies to retrieve the assets from these security researchers,\" a Kraken spokesperson told CoinDesk.

The accused, Manideep Mago, was produced before a special court that sent him to ED custody till June 23. The ED investigation concerns a Delhi-based company that had sold crypto-currencies worth more than \u20b91,858 crore on various crypto exchanges.
